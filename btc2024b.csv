Building a Parallel Society — Is Decentralization the Answer to Government Overreach?,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been increasingly frustrated with how things work today:  
Banks freezing your money, crypto purchases blocked by KYC and sketchy third parties, natural health remedies restricted or banned, and everything under constant surveillance and regulation. Privacy, autonomy, financial freedom… it almost feels radical just to *want* those things.

That’s why I’m working on an alternative: a **decentralized ecosystem** where people decide how they live, pay, and produce. Imagine:

* Tools to receive crypto directly without intermediaries (e.g., iDeal → wallet)
* Local barter or trade networks with custom tokens or reputation systems
* Community-driven governance (DAO-style) where everyone has voting power
* Freedom in natural medicine, food production, and housing

**My question to you:**  
Would you be interested in helping build or brainstorm this?  
I’m looking for devs, crypto tool builders, designers, organizers, legal minds — or just people with passion for freedom and decentralization.

Do you think this is realistic? Do you have tips, existing projects to look at, or critique?

Thanks for reading 🙏

Self Custody made me paranoid,"Guys, I see so many stories of people who suddenly have their wallets emptied that I'm becoming more paranoid every day. 

Do you see any flaws in my system?

I currently have my seed engraved on a metal plate, which is hidden away. My private keys are stored on a Satochip-type hardware wallet (smartcard).

When I make a transaction, I launch a dedicated virtual machine on my PC, which only has an up-to-date paid antivirus program and an Electrum wallet installed. My physical smartcard allows me to open the Electrum wallet and sign transactions.

Should I split my BTC across several wallets? Do you see any improvement point ?

Bitcoin Coast FIRE,"Coast FIRE is a concept where you've already accumulated enough investments to retire early at some point in the future. Without investing a penny more.

Sparrow Wallet scam.  I knew better but I need to get this off of my chest.,"I've been a hodler (ColdCard) for 3 years and fell for a scam - I survived Celsius and Blockfi so there's that.  I used Sparrow Wallet for a watch only wallet and was trying to move it a new computer.  I reached out to the official Sparrow Wallet telegram group for support and somehow got sidetracked into another group.  They directed me to a fake sparrow wallet website: sparrow-firmware.com/en/en.  I don't know why but I fell for entering my 24 words - I was in a hurry and not focused, again I should have known better.  Anyway, my wallet was drained in seconds (.64 BTC) and I started receiving multiple telegram calls on my phone.  I knew I was toast.  They then tried to convince me that it was a software issue and could help ""revoke"" the transaction.  Asked me to go to this website (another scam): desk.sparrowtxt.com   to help recover my funds.  It was a gut wrenching, sick to the stomach feeling.  I filed an IC3 complaint (not sure if being over 60 helps) and I know my stack is gone for good.  I've decided to stick to BTC ETF's from now on.  Here's the wallet that drained my BTC on July 16th: bc1ql40xgvw4zmfrc9u7qy46n0e3pl2nfrv9ydjuqu.  I looked up the ""who is"" domain info, one site is registered in CA and the other one in India. It would be a shame if one of these sites came under a DDoS attack or better yet they became a ransomeware victim.  I was kicked out of the Telegram group but it's still active (registered with another phone number).  I hope someone can learn from my lesson.

I just learned why test transactions are REALLY important when setting up cold storage (lost coins),"I’m 7 months into my journey and finally decided to get cold storage. I’ve always heard the advice, “always send a small transaction first before sending the full stack.” Let me tell you, there’s a reason people say that.

I’m still trying to figure out exactly what I did wrong but here’s what happened:

I set up cold storage (Jade), and a mobile wallet attached to it. Sent a test transaction, then decided to make sure I could send from the wallet back to the exchange to make sure everything worked. It did. It worked fine.

Then, as an extra precaution, I factory reset my cold storage device to make sure I could recover it with my written backups. After doing that, I tried reconnecting to the same wallet and approving a send of the rest back to the exchange. But I just kept getting error messages. It wouldn’t approve or send the bitcoin.

I tried exporting the wallet to three other wallet apps and they all show 0 bitcoin. So I’m guessing when I recovered my wallet using the seed phrase and the 25th word passphrase, I must’ve typed something wrong. Probably just one letter or number off in the 25th word, which created a totally different wallet.

So now the original wallet I used for the test transaction is basically lost unless I somehow guess the exact 25th word. I might’ve just donated 5 bucks to the bitcoin network and lowered the total supply forever. You’re welcome.

Waiting on banking compliance when your origin of funds is Bitcoin? You might wait forever.,"One of the strangest parts of helping Bitcoin/crypto clients open private bank accounts is watching the “compliance limbo” play out.

Here’s how it often goes:

The banker is eager to sign you up. He sees your assets, knows his commission depends on onboarding you, and reassures you “it won’t be a problem.”

You provide a first round of documents: wallet screenshots, exchange statements, KYC files. The banker forwards it to compliance.

Compliance asks for more. And more. Trade histories, old exchange receipts, even explanations of transactions from 2014.

Then one day… silence. No “yes,” no “no.” Just no reply.

This isn’t because the bank forgot about you. It’s because, internally, they don’t want to reject you outright (which would close the door on a potential client), but they also aren’t comfortable approving you. So they “ghost” you.

Many people assume if they just send one more document, things will move. But if compliance has already mentally decided they don’t like the case, the file will sit there indefinitely.

A few takeaways from what I’ve seen:

The banker’s enthusiasm doesn’t mean compliance agrees. Bankers sell; compliance protects the bank’s license.

“No answer” is often the real answer. When a file stops moving, it’s rarely revived.

Good prep changes everything. A complete, well-documented crypto history (with forensic reports, structured explanations, etc.) can prevent a case from stalling before it starts.

Disclosure: I work in this space professionally (Swiss-regulated financial intermediary) and we’ve helped multiple clients who were “stuck in limbo” get unstuck by structuring their files properly before approaching banks.

Has anyone here had a bank just… stop replying during the process? Did you manage to turn it around, or did you have to start fresh elsewhere?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1md9mlt/waiting_on_banking_compliance_when_your_origin_of/,True,2025-07-30 15:28:51+00:00,"Error:

Everyone says DCA - But did anyone actually start off with a DCA?,"I know that the wisdom is to DCA, but I personally don't know anyone who got into crypto by DCAing their way in. Usually its FOMO and you lump sum, and then go through a bear market, where to DCA your way through if you're smart, or you DCA once the bull market picks up again.

So... Redditors who had a ""lump sum"" to start - Did you DCA it?

I'm curious if anyone here actually got into crypto by slowly DCAing their way in rather than starting out with a bang, regardless of whether you started DCAing later.

From personal experience I know how hard it is to DCA when everything is shooting up, so I was curious.

Also, if you were ""forced"" to DCA, due to financials, I guess this question doesn't apply to you.

I'm more curious about those who had a choice.

Who does BTC help more- 3rd world or 1st world country folk?,"I saw a post today that said ""I am from first world and this is my escape route"" (Paraphrased). 

  
This caught me off-guard.  I would have thought countries like Argentina with double/triple digit inflation or third world countries where - ""if you don't have money - you don't matter"" - benefit the most?

How do you leave Bitcoin in your Will without risking someone taking it?,"I’m thinking about getting into Bitcoin and want to understand how it could passed on in the event of my death, without the risk of it being accessed while I’m still alive.

My biggest concern is this:
How do you securely leave your seed phrase/private keys or access details to someone (like an executor or family member) without them being able to access or steal the funds prematurely?

What do you recommend for someone who wants to:

1. Keep control during their lifetime

2. Ensure smooth access by loved ones or executors after death

3. Avoid technical risk and legal ambiguity

Open to all ideas, DIY setups, legal strategies, or even trusted third-party solutions.

Started,"Just wanted to say, that my mindset changed 
I started accumulating yesterday, im around since 2022 hust thought I wasn't worthy of being a bitcoiner as i saw 1 bitcoin as much today i see 0.01 will be much in the next 20 years to come.
I used to throw 1k a month into shit coins until i reached the gutter.
Now my plan is to reach DCA 0.001 weekly and every 90 days 0.01.
1 idea changed my thoughts, todays children who are growing up eating chocolate made in 2025 in 20 years it will be their go to chocolate

What happens if Bitcoin reaches $1 million?,"

# Is $1-million Bitcoin possible?



So, is $1 million per Bitcoin a realistic target? Several key factors suggest that it is entirely possible, though achieving it will require a lot. 

* Limited supply: Bitcoin’s scarcity is one of its most compelling features. With a capped [supply of 21 million coins](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/93-of-all-bitcoin-is-already-mined-heres-what-that-means), Bitcoin’s value naturally increases as demand rises. The limited supply ensures that Bitcoin cannot be inflated like fiat currencies, making it a potential store of [value similar to gold](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-transformation-from-risk-asset-to-digital-gold-hints-a-new-all-time-highs).
* Institutional investment: The influx of institutional investment is changing Bitcoin’s market dynamics. As large financial institutions enter the market, Bitcoin’s legitimacy is solidified, creating more demand and pushing prices higher.
* Crypto adoption potential: Approximately [6.8%](https://www.triple-a.io/cryptocurrency-ownership-data/cryptocurrency-ownership-data) of the global population now owns cryptocurrency, equating to over 560 million people (with a compound annual growth rate of around 34%). There’s plenty of room for growth. 
* FOMO: A 2025 [survey](https://www.security.org/digital-security/cryptocurrency-annual-consumer-report) by [Security.org](http://Security.org) found that 67% of current cryptocurrency owners primarily invest in digital assets like Bitcoin with the expectation of making money. As Bitcoin’s price continues to rise, more investors are subjected to [fear of missing out](https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-fomo-back-bitcoin-first-timers-buy-140k-btc-in-2-weeks).

The big shift,"The majority of global wealth is in the hands of boomers, who are skeptical about bitcoin. Estimates suggest they hold well over half of all household wealth, while millennials and gen Z hold only a small fraction.

Over the next decade, trillions of dollars will change hands as boomers pass on their fortunes. Younger generations are far more open to bitcoin, yet many are stuck on the sidelines today because they simply don’t have the capital.

Bitcoin gift,"Hey Reddit!
So there’s this guy who’s into me, and he wants to send me like $100 worth of Bitcoin as a gift. The thing is, I live in Italy and he is in a different country, and I’ve literally never used Bitcoin or any crypto before. I’m kind of scared because I don’t really understand how it works, and I’m worried if there might be any legal issues or tax problems if I receive it.

Has anyone here received Bitcoin as a gift in Italy?
Are there any laws I should know about?
Do I have to report it or pay taxes?
Is it safe to accept?
Also, any tips on how to convert it to euros easily without getting scammed?

Would really appreciate any advice or personal stories! Thanks a lot

The reason to buy BTC from someone who isn't a shill.,"I have been reading up on Bitcoin and following posts in this subreddit and the buttcoin subreddit for some time. I think each side makes certain overblown claims, and a lot of the discussions aren't very realistic or fruitful. 

My background is as a software and aerospace engineer. I found the tech behind bitcoin fascinating, and found the thesis outlined in books like *The Bitcoin Standard* mostly logical. But, I found people like Saylor repugnant and foolish. So I was sort of torn between ""I like the tech"" and ""I hate the online community of shills."" 

I wanted to share my ultimate decision to hold >= 10% of my account in BTC at all times. I hope it may appeal to people on the fence about bitcoin. The reason I decided to buy BTC, if for absolutely nothing else, ignoring all potential for appreciation, is as a hedge against my country. I don't want to trust the governments of ANY country to honor their currencies and to not confiscate property in times of crisis. 

**The fundamental, immediately actionable thing that BTC offers is the ability to redeem your money cross-border**. This isn't unique to BTC as this is true for most cryptocurrencies, but it's simply the most widely transacted coin and thus is the best hedge. No government can stop you from moving to another country and redeeming your wealth if you memorize your seed phrase and store it in a cold wallet. Yes, in a crisis you will take a huge hit on the spot because it will be a buyer's market -- but that's okay. You can eat, you can find a place to live, you can barter, etc. You have the ability to go to any other country and survive so long as you are not detained or killed. Every government can (and will) reduce the flow of wealth out of their country in times of crisis. Gold, USD, diamonds, food, silver, etc., can and will be confiscated at borders. Bitcoin cannot be confiscated without killing you. You are basically hedging that regardless of the state of your country, you have a currency that is very likely to be transactable and essentially impossible to confiscate. This, to me, is worth 10% of a portfolio.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mcop29/the_reason_to_buy_btc_from_someone_who_isnt_a/,True,2025-07-29 21:51:06+00:00,"Error:

Denominating Bitcoin,"To progress the adoption of Bitcoin as a standalone currency, it seems necessary to denominate various amounts of bitcoin in shorter phrases. For example, it’s inconvenient to say “fifty-thousand satoshis” rather than 5 “pringles” with each pringle denominating 10,000 satoshis. Of course, pringles happen to be the arbitrary word I’ve chosen based on the snacks available to me at the moment.

1. I’m not a money guy, I’m a freedom guy, so my goal is to escape the rat race and enjoy more time and experience with my future children (29M engaged) - the game I’m playing isn’t how to have as much money as possible for me to retire from when I’m 60, it’s to enjoy life and serve others. 

2. Since I’m not a money guy, the game I play is going to be investing my money in places that are good for humanity, not one stock comes close to the value BTC can provide to the world. 

3. Why not go all in? Most people don’t even think about investing until they’re in their 30s/40s.. so if my stack ever = 0 then I’ll move on and perhaps consider diversifying then lol

4. Not financial advice, just what I’m doing. Next step is the BTC standard because I no longer want to use fiat, I’d rather wipe my ace with it someday (kidding but fiat sucks)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mcjqa6/fortune_favors_the_bold/,True,2025-07-29 18:41:39+00:00,"Error:

"$25,000 a year, Received first paycheck. I'll start bitcoin and let time do the work. RANT.","Got my first paycheck Friday last week, spent the whole weekend thinking about what to do with it. It was a slog to get that job. I get $25,000 USD a year, or $481 a week. I realized it was less because apparently, employers withhold a little bit for taxes. No one ever taught me that. And it might seem stupid to some, but I felt I was betrayed learning about things and systems generally designed to financially fuck with the average person.

Got no house, living with parents. No car. $2k in debt (0% APR for a few months), since I've been attending an online college (WGU) with hopes for a better future. I shouldn't be complaining since there's other folks who have it worse. There's probably a ton of folks in my position from Generational Alpha.

Been lurking in the thread for a year now, if I had a job back then, I would have started back then. In my younger years, never would I have thought that I would feel so defeated using my first paycheck.

I don't want the newest shiny. I lived with hand me downs my entire life. I just want the feeling of safety that has eluded me this entire time. A place to rest comfortably, and maybe somebody cool to share that place with. This is another dream, out of many lost dreams.

I'll DCA BITCOIN in strike for $100 a week. And maybe when I have extra cash, I'll pop in a cheeky lump sum. I'll get a hard wallet at some point, then do that shenanigans, because I am incredibly skeptical of everything. If strike pulls an FTX, it is what it is.

Lots of regrets in life and knowing my luck, I'm probably buying at the top. If shit hits the fan, it is what it is. I might come back to this post after a few years, but honestly I hope my future self can just look back, see some progress, and be a little grateful I started here now.

TLDR. Life sucks. Low energy, took me an hour to write this before work. Going for homerun with bitcoin. Withdraw to cold storage. I ain't touching this for years. And I got to get to work.

Edit: Thanks for the information guys. Sorry about lashing out about the taxes, I know why it's important and I'm always grateful that taxes can be used to give everyone a fair chance at schooling, for good roads, to help the elderly in retirement, and to help those who need it most. I had a small crash out, after realizing 20% of my pay was deducted. Taxes are not theft. And I need to do my research.

A few corrections and details.

I'm Gen Z not Alpha. Early 20s. Sorry about the confusion. Studying at WGU for my Bachelor of Information Technology for about 1 and 1/2 years. 63% done.

I did know about taxes, I originally had the impression, that you would pay them at the end of the tax year, like a utility bill arriving to your door (now that I think about it, I'm kinda dumb thinking like that). I will research the basics of taxes, as I will work and pay them of the rest of my life.

One guy asked for my job. I'm in D2D home remodeling sales, compensation is $25,000 with 2% commission. I pay for gas, and drive around the neighborhood to sell windows, roofs, and siding. I'm grateful and very fortunate for the opportunity to work and I believe that this job will help me with my confidence. I learnt a lot of new things every day and I'm thankful for my mentors at work. And yeah, I haven't sold anything in 3 weeks, so I do feel kinda incompetent, but I believe that's a work in progress.

As for advice, I'm really glad I posted this because the advice in the replies solid foundation to work on.

Here's a basic breakdown of my finances. Around $1600 a month, after the withheld wages.

\- $655 to pay off college monthly

\- $300 to pay off my 2k debt. I believe I have around 7-8 months left of 0% APR.

\- $450 to set up Bitcoin DCA (estimated a month).

\- The remainder is for fuel, groceries, and stuff I may need (around $150) (maybe a bit low, but I do ask my parents for money, only for necessities). Thankfully, my family is really accommodating so they'll help me out for fuel expenses, toll expenses, and food (since I'll be driving around a lot, and we are a big family). They also let me use their spare car. I don't really eat out or buy things, aside for $18 for 5 dozen eggs, since I like the sound of frying eggs, cooking them, and eating them. I'd rather fry 5 eggs than eat a fast food meal.

What I learnt:

I know the 2k debt, even with 0% APR, is a ticking time bomb waiting to go off. So if in practice, it isn't enough, I'll cancel the DCA, for something like $25-50 a week. But the most important part is paying of debt. I still want to build the habit of buying bitcoin, so I will get started with $100 this week.

In conclusion, I'll focus on doing a good job at work, and graduating college. I will prioritize paying off my debt within the 0% APR timeframe, and will stop Bitcoin DCA if I fall behind on the credit card payments.

I will set up a Roth IRA in the future after the debt is paid, I remember having this in my notes somewhere.

From VTI and VXUS to Bitcoin: How a friend (and a YouTube video) changed everything,"For over a decade, I’ve been a disciplined, long-term investor. I started with VTI and VXUS, but later switched to VWRL combined with bonds, since local regulations made it impossible to invest in VTI and VXUS directly. I always believed in broad diversification, low fees, and holding for the long run. Boring, sensible, and until recently, my entire investing worldview.

One of my best friends, someone I’ve traveled with frequently over the years, is a Bitcoiner. Every trip, he tried to explain Bitcoin to me. And every time, I’d shoot it down. ""It’s a scam, it’s tulip mania, it’s just another Ponzi"", I'd say.

I wasn’t rude about it (I hope), but I genuinely thought he had lost his critical thinking somewhere along the way. I’d smile, nod, and go back to rebalancing my equity-bond allocation.

Fast forward to our most recent vacation earlier this year; we were in Egypt. One day at the pool, he asked if I’d be willing to watch a short video. Just one. *What is the Problem* by Joe Bryan. I rolled my eyes but said sure.

And something happened.

That video didn’t just explain Bitcoin, it reframed the entire problem. The monetary system, incentives, time preference… all of it. I rewatched it that same night, and many times since. The next day, I started listening to audiobooks on Spotify. Suddenly, all the pieces clicked. The arguments I used to make started to sound hollow, like someone parroting talking points without understanding the game.

Now I’m gradually converting the bond portion of my portfolio into Bitcoin. Not recklessly, but with more conviction than I ever had holding government debt. This isn’t just a new asset class, it’s a whole new lens.

To my friend, if you ever read this: thanks for being patient.

To others who are still where I was: maybe just watch that one video.

But I've been able to accomplish a dream that many of us have today. And its having enough wealth to work 2-3 days a weak. But to be fare, life sucks now. I've been earlier stressfully overworking for years. And now it feels like I do not have a reason to wake up. 

I do have plenty of free-time activities, but still, it feels empty, and days are passing without anything meaningfull. 

  
Working more isnt an option, cause I'm afraid of dying as a workaholic!

"""We are still early"" is not a meme, its the truth","You know, especially people that started getting BTC recently, like to say that ""we are still early"" and a year ago i already felt like that they need to reaffirm themself. Because institutions and companies were already getting onboard and, I mean, understanding and saving in Bitcoin can be scary in the beginning because its a huge paradigm shift. By all means it's like taking the red pill in the matrix.

But now this feeling has completly shifted. Because it doesnt matter where you look, like 95% of the people dont care about bitcoin or out right hate it, even though they havent looked into it or into our monetary system. Each and every subreddit, doesnt matter how i phrase it, every comment gets downvoted into oblivion.

A post about inflation? Mentioning BTC as a hedge gets you downvoted. A story about the recent whale sale? Mentioning that its still not to late to start investing gets you downvoted. A friend complaining that he cant save money for a downpayment? Mentioning that i multiplied my FIAT since i got in gets you a ""you were just lucky"". Again and again we are proved to be right and again and again the majority turns a blind eye to the revolution that is happening right now in front of everbodys eyes. And thats the point:

For us it might feel, that we arent that early anymore. But mass adoption, atleast as a store of value, hasnt even started yet. And that, when your sure to be right but most people dont see it, that was always the golden opportunity. Your grandchildren will be thankful for it. And many wounds of this world will heal when inflation - this fundamental human problem - is finally fixed.

🚀 I automated my Bitcoin DCA strategy in a weekend using n8n and AI – my first workflow project,"Hey folks! Just wanted to share something I built over a weekend that turned out to be way more useful (and fun) than I expected.

It started with a random vacation thought:  
**""Why am I still manually checking the Fear & Greed Index every week?""**

That rabbit hole led to building a full-blown automated Bitcoin DCA system using n8n and conversational AI. I didn’t write a single line of code myself – everything from the logic, workflows, and even backtesting scripts was done through AI-assisted iterations.

Here’s what I ended up with:

* ✅ Fully automated DCA logic based on Fear & Greed Index
* 📈 Trend-aware profit taking logic
* 📊 Backtested across 4 years of market data
* 🔍 Risk-focused design (not just chasing profits)

Some interesting takeaways:

* Simple DCA still shines in bull markets
* My logic-based DCA reduced bear market losses by **9-11%**
* Max drawdown reduced by **\~29%**
* Running on Docker + n8n – production-ready in minutes

🧠 The coolest part? I used no-code tools + AI prompting to build something that would've taken days or weeks in traditional dev workflows.

This was my **first real n8n project**, so I’d **love any feedback** from the community:

* How do you build robust automation logic in n8n?
* Any thoughts on managing secrets / state across executions?
* How do you balance between code and no-code?

If you’re curious, I also wrote up a blog post with the details and thought process:

"Getting Paid in Bitcoin, Earning BTC Cashback, and Saving in a BTC HYSA - Should I Still Track Gains/Losses or Just Keep Stacking?","I’m deep in the Bitcoin game and could use some advice. I get paid in BTC, have a recurring purchase set up from my savings, use a Gemini card that gives cashback in BTC, and keep my savings in a high-yield savings account (HYSA) that pays interest in Bitcoin.

BTC staking VS borrowing against bitcoin,"\[Edit\] Don't just downvote and say that BTC staking is bad. I'm asking your opinion on Staking VS borrowing against bitcoin. Have you done any of them? If you're still saving, you probably don't care. Assume that 2 years from now, you need to sell your BTC to cover daily expenses, and you have this possibility to avoid selling at all. This is the mindset in which I'm asking the question.

In this sub I often saw discussions about how to live off BTC without actually selling BTC and one of the idea that seems the more widespread is the concept of borrowing against BTC. One of the major advantage is that by doing so you're keeping custody of your coins.

But there's now staking offered for BTC. What is the general consensus of BTC staking? Kraken is now offering 1% APR by staking BTC ([link](https://www.kraken.com/features/staking/bitcoin)) and from what i read, this is a general direction that all major exchanges are trying to go for. And the general idea was that 1% is very low right now, but that sooner or later one of the main exchange is going to offer something way better than that, and that they will probably win the race of BTC staking.

Of course, not your keys not your coins. So it does not seem like a good idea at first glance.

But I don't know, 3% and above could be seriously attracting people, especially the ones who already have their coins in an exchange and do not want self-custody for various reasons. In the long run, that could mean living off this APR without having to sell.

I have seen mostly excitement following that news. So I wonder.

I'm expecting most answers will tell me it's terrible and that borrowing against BTC is much better. But still curious to see what everyone thinks about.

Borrowing against bitcoin also has some risks when considering downturns and paying back?

Casascius BTC - 1BTC coins,"As someone who uses a hardware wallet, since let's face it - *not your keys, not your coins* \- there is a particular challenge to dealing with BTC locked up into Casascius coins.

I used to have quite a few of these, back in the day I bought a bunch to give out as curiosities at meetups for people who were just learning what Bitcoin was about.  It basically has all the risks of any paper cold-storage wallet, wrapped under a hologram in a coin.

That said many people still have them, with half, whole, 10, and even 100BTC loaded.  It's a hell of a way to HODL, since the coins themselves require the minikey to be extracted after peeling the hologram, converted, then the coins transferred to a safer wallet.

Are people just keeping these locked up bank vaults now?  How do you deal with a 1BTC ( or higher! ) paper wallet in the modern era?  Is it even WORTH doing that just to maintain the integrity of the artifact?

FIAT mindset: The fear of deflation,"They say deflation is bad because no one will spend if money gains value. But people usually don’t make spending decisions based on inflation charts. They buy what they need or want.
If you're a bitcoin maxi and want a PS5 Pro, would you really wait a couple of years just to pay less BTC for it? Sure, it might only cost 0.0005 BTC then instead of 0.005 now, but you’d also miss out on years of fun. Time preference is real.

Help me invest as a beginner,"All I know about crypto is that its a peer to peer transactions. I was about to buy BTC worth $115 which is enough in my currency. However on the official website, the conversion shows 0.00075 for $100 but the present value is around .00085. I can take it because its huge for my currency

  
Please help me get a trustable source and also I know the growth is guaranteed but how much should I wait for it to show some gains? i mean I can be patient but I am not. Its .00085 so idk how much decimals do they round off while converting which will cause way too much time to have enough

Took The Plunge,"So after being in Bitcoin for roughly over a year now I decided it was time to go full send and live off of virtually the Bitcoin standard. I do have a few bills left being paid in fiat due to not being able to pay them with a credit card but daily purchases and 80 percent of bills are through a credit card. I am currently allocating a certain amount every week to the fiat bills and the rest is being put into Bitcoin. Needless to say it was a very big jump and I was nervous at first (very nervous) but over time I feel this is going to be a game changer for the future. I am using Strike for my purchases weekly with my income and paying the credit card off monthly before due date. So far so good. With institutional adoption growing everyday I feel that the downturns will not be as violent as the past although no one has a crystal ball to tell the future. I foresee at least 170,000 this cycle if the cycles are a thing anymore (which they could be). In the event of a downturn I see that as a time for more accumulation even though I will be losing in fiat terms. Thoughts and comments are appreciated.

🌴 Looking to Buy a Booking.com or LastMinute.com Voucher (Bit of a Discount if Possible!),"Hey everyone,
Bit of a random ask, but I was wondering if anyone has a Booking.com or LastMinute.com voucher they’re not planning to use and might be willing to sell at a bit of a discount?

I’m currently on a family holiday and honestly, it’s been the best week we’ve had in ages — so much proper quality time together. We’re meant to head home later today, but we’re all a bit gutted it’s ending. I’d love to try and surprise my parents by extending it just a little longer.

Totally understand if not, but thought it was worth asking. Thanks so much in advance!

Having bitcoin in Italy…,"

I’m currently doing DCA with Bitcoin, and I was looking into my country’s tax laws when I found out that starting next year, capital gains will be taxed at 33%, whereas until 2025 it was 26%.
I don’t plan to sell in the short term, so things could still change over the years — I’m just frustrated because the government is always trying to screw us over.

BTC vs. MSFT,"I’m a long term (25+ years since investment, zero added capital, reinvesting dividends) Microsoft stock holder trying to work out how to deal with this money in my Bitcoin portfolio. 

On one hand, Bitcoin is inevitable and I should put every available cent into Satoshis to save its value against a slowly collapsing dollar. 

On the other hand, Microsoft has shown to be a pretty resilient company that seems to be pretty integrated into the world as we know it.

Is this as simple as choosing between the world we have and the world that hasn’t arrived yet?

I am seeing a lot of OG's selling but my issue with this commentary is..,"Is that it has served their purpose for their own lives. Not yours. Not mine.

Suddenly it is not convenient for them to publicly endorse Bitcoin?

I find it a very self-centered point of view. Bitcoin cant decide who can and cannot get involved. To think otherwise goes against the decentralised nature of Bitcoin.

Furthermore, of course they would consider selling, one has to live in the present too. If they got in extremely early they never have to think about money again.. even if their money is debased, even the most disciplined holder would consider moving on or selling down.

Bitcoin for many is hope and will continue to be hope. The new OG's of today will one day do be faced with the same dilemma which ironically would be a privilege to be in (to decide to let go of one of the hardest assets on earth to convert to trash fiat).

Each person will have their own philosophy and approach (ie sell down slowly , partly and so on) dependent on their needs and risk tolerance.

I just find it very self-centered when I hear OG's saying ""I am done with Bitcoin as it is no longer true to its origin"".  Then they move on, their incentive structure changes, and they shill the next project .

Bitcoin will continue to evolve as humanity progresses for better or worse.

Apologies if I am rambling I just find it frustrating and you can totally see how their words are completely different due to their incentives changing... their worldview is very different to those struggling today....

Here's why bitcoin is my saving grace as a third-world dweller,"I'm 22, fresh out of college. I've been following bitcoin since 2016. I remember it was $500 a coin when I first asked my mom to invest in it. She obviously didn't think taking financial advice from a teenager was a sound idea lol. Still, I don't blame her and don't regret not having money as a teenager to buy bitcoin. 

I still think bitcoin is worth it at 120k and it'll be worth it when it hits 1m. I live in a third-world country and the inflation is terrible here. In the past 5 years, the dollar has doubled in value against my currency, and bitcoin has increased 10x in value against the dollar. That's 20x gains for me. 

Ever since I first started earning I've been saving exclusively in bitcoin. I'm nowhere near owning a whole coin (my first job paid $50/month) but I'm still worth more than 90% people my age in my country, thanks to bitcoin.

Buying crypto is also illegal in my country so we have to buy bitcoin P2P. If the government detects you've been buying crypto they block your bank account and freeze your assets. I got my bank account blocked once and that made me realize even more just how valuable bitcoin is. It's the only way to truly own your money. If you keep your money in the bank you're at the mercy of the government and the bank to ""let"" you use it.

I intend to continue stacking sats as my sole savings strategy. I wonder if I'll ever own an entire coin with my measly salary that keeps going down against the dollar. I know it's just an arbitrary number but it's my longterm goal to be a whole-coiner. But even if I don't get there I'm glad to be a part of the bitcoin community.

How can I access BTC in a very old Blockchain.info wallet? I have the backup phrase and login ID,"Over a decade ago I made a small experiment with Bitcoin. I created a wallet on Blockchain and converted a bit of money into BTC, just to try it out. I used some of it to buy food from a Dutch delivery service that accepted bitcoin at the time. I left the rest of the funds in the wallet and moved on.

Yesterday I checked that wallet address on a public explorer and saw that the leftover coins have grown in value a lot, way more than I expected.

Here's what I still have:  
I know the bitcoin address.  
I have the old-style recovery phrase (18 words, not 12).

When I log into the website now, it shows my BTC address, but the balance is zero. I assume the new interface isn't compatible with the older type of wallet I had. It offers to generate a private key, but from what I understand that won't help recover the old funds.

Buying BTC for the first time - Avoiding exchanges. Struggling.,"Is it really this hard? Hoping someone has a nice solution here.

So, want to start buying BTC. For my first purchase, my plan was going P2P. I dont want to touch exchanges.

So, my plan was to try out Bisq, but I found out I need to front up BTC on that platform - which I dont have yet.

I went to RoboSats - found a seller, but they don't do on chain. So seeing as I cant go direct to my sparrow wallet with any purchase, I opened an electrum wallet - but I cant open a lightning channel, because again, I dont have BTC.

Found another seller on Robosats that offers on chain delivery. But when trying to place the order, I realise I have to put up BTC to ""spot"" the trade.

Is there no way for me to buy P2P for the first time without actually having any current BTC holdings?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mawkq1/buying_btc_for_the_first_time_avoiding_exchanges/,True,2025-07-27 20:24:35+00:00,"Error:

Strike vs River convince me,"I’m based in the US and looking to invest in Bitcoin through a company/platform that makes custody, DCA, and general BTC savings easy and secure.

I keep coming across **Strike** and **River** :  both seem to be US-based and Bitcoin-focused, but I’m having a hard time understanding the key differences between them. Things I care about:

* security/custody (especially who holds the keys) 
* ease of recurring purchases (DCA)
* fees
* ability to withdraw to cold storage easily
* long-term viability/trustworthiness

"Crypto… too late, or too early?","Hi all,

Forgive my naivety — I’m very new to the world of crypto.

To be honest, I’ve always been a bit put off by how cryptocurrencies are portrayed in mainstream media — as incredibly risky, volatile, and at times even scam-adjacent. That reputation kept me on the sidelines for years.

But after finally doing some of my own research, I can’t help but feel like I’ve been missing out. I’ve recently invested a small amount just to test the waters, but I’m holding off on putting more in for now — partly because I’m still learning, and partly because I’m wondering if there might be a better time to go deeper.

So I guess my question to this community is:
Have I missed the boat… or is this still the early innings of something much bigger?

Would love to hear your honest takes, especially from those who’ve been in the space a while.

Thanks in advance!

Second half of 2025 up to 2026 BTC Forecast Based on Historical Data (DYOR),"# Forecast for Q3 & Q4 2025: The Euphoric Peak



Historical analysis suggests that the current bull market, which began after the 2022 low and was catalyzed by the April 2024 halving, is likely to reach its peak in late 2025.This period corresponds to the ""Bubble"" or ""Euphoria"" phase of the cycle, which is typically characterized by exponential price increases, intense media coverage, and peak retail investor interest. 



* **Timing the Peak:** Previous bull markets in 2017 and 2021 reached their peaks between 1,059 and 1,068 days after the cycle began. Applying a similar timeframe to the current cycle points toward a potential top in Q4 2025, with some analysts specifically highlighting October as a possibility.On-chain analysts also note that as of mid-2025, the market is approaching the ""thrill and euphoria phase,"" which historically precedes the cycle top. 
* **Potential Price Levels:**
   * Some analytical models, which compare the current cycle to the average of the 2015-2018 and 2018-2022 cycles, project a potential peak price of around **$243,000 to $250,000**.This is supported by on-chain metrics like the MVRV Z-Score, which has historically correlated with market tops. 
   * A more conservative forecast from Trading Economics projects a price of **$112,308** by the end of Q3 2025. 

Based on these patterns, Q3 2025 would likely be a period of strong, continued price growth. Q4 2025 is the most probable window for the cycle to enter a parabolic advance and achieve its ultimate peak for this cycle.



# Forecast for 2026: The Bear Market Correction



Historically, every parabolic bull market peak has been followed by a significant and prolonged correction, often called a ""bear market"" or ""crypto winter"". This ""Crash"" phase is driven by a sharp shift in market sentiment from greed to fear, as early investors take profits and selling pressure overwhelms demand. 



* **Magnitude of Correction:** Previous bear markets have consistently resulted in major drawdowns from the peak price. The 2018 bear market saw a price decline of over 83%, while the 2022 correction was a drop of nearly 78% from the 2021 all-time high. 
* **Potential Price Levels in 2026:** Applying a historical drawdown of approximately 80% to the projected 2025 peak gives a potential target for the 2026 market bottom:
   * If the peak reaches **$250,000**, an 80% correction would imply a low of around **$50,000**.
   * If the peak is a more modest **$150,000**, an 80% correction would imply a low of **$30,000**.
* **Timeline:** These corrective periods typically last for about a year, characterized by negative or sideways price action. Therefore, the entirety of 2026 would likely be defined by a downtrend as the market searches for a bottom. One forecast suggests a price of **$96,627** by July 2026, reflecting the downward trajectory from a potential 2025 peak. 

In summary, if historical cycles repeat, 2026 is expected to be a bear market year, with prices falling significantly from the highs of late 2025 before eventually entering a new accumulation phase to begin the next cycle. While the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs has fundamentally altered market dynamics, many analysts believe the powerful forces of human psychology that have driven these cycles remain intact.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1mamrc3/second_half_of_2025_up_to_2026_btc_forecast_based/,True,2025-07-27 13:49:12+00:00,"Error:

How do I turn my passion for Bitcoin into a full-time job?,"Hi all, looking for guidance *and* connections.

I’m an electrical engineer with solid backend software experience, used to working at large companies. I’m a proud maxi, have read widely, and have a strong grasp of the network, incentives, and the core algorithms.

**What I’m aiming for**  
  
I’m truly passionate about Bitcoin and would love a paying, Bitcoin-only role centered on **advocacy/education/devrel/policy outreach**. Perhaps a translator between deeply technical work and the public, institutions, developers, and policymakers. *Remote work would be ideal but any good starting point would be welcomed.*

**What I bring**

* EE + SWE background (can build demos, write docs, teach, and talk to engineers *and* non-technical audiences).  
* Comfortable writing long-form explainers and giving talks/workshops. I’ve previously given lectures on Bitcoin to large and small groups of engineers. 
* Experience with most custody arrangements and teaching others how to self-custody. 

**My specific asks for the community**

1. **Playbooks:** If you’ve made this transition, how did you do it? What worked, what didn’t?  
2. **Proof-of-Work that matters:** For landing a role like this, what matters most? Technical writing, conference talks, curriculum building, translation?  
3. **Who’s hiring:** Which *Bitcoin-only* companies, nonprofits, and programs should I target for advocacy/education/devrel/policy roles?  
4. **Warm intros welcome:** If you work at (or know) a team that needs this skill set, I’d love an intro.  

*Non-negotiable: Bitcoin-only.*

"What would you do, if you were me? Questions about protecting my BTC.","I have a non insignificant amount of BTC. Right now I keep it on a Ledger Nano X that's mostly never connected (though charged somewhat regularly). 

Right now, what protects my BTC is a ledger nano device that I keep hidden in my house. The 24 words are written on a piece of card stock and protected from the elements (as well as UV, moisture... etc) but lets just say where they are stored is less than ideal and the storage medium is less than idea to protect my seed. 

  
Nothing beyond that. The 24 words. And a pin on my Ledger device. 



  
I was considering getting the 24 words put into something more secure. I don't want to store them digitally at all, ever. 

Metal plates are a bit obvious. Unless I somehow embossed a lot more than 24 words and worked out some system or did some sort of ""encryption"" on the words. My fear that is that I'd forget how I encrypted them. Metal plates are a bit predictable as well. 



So would you stop using the ledger device? If so what other device would you use? I'd note again, I never did any sort of recovery system setup with ledger (it's a newer thing, I got my ledger back in 2019 IIRC). 

How would you store / protect your own seed?

  
Anything else that I should consider? Some form of multi factor protection beyond just the 24 words?

  
I honestly figure since I have a very significant amount of money in BTC, I should do some due diligence to protect it better. Right now, my system is equivalent to storing some loot in a mayonnaise jar hidden under the basement steps. A lot could go wrong. I need to do better.

Getting a loan on my Bitcoin to buy 50% of a house,"Help me do a sanity check on my plan. 

I own 26 Bitcoin that I bought in 2013. Never touched it. I own a house currently with a mortgage at 2.75%. Me and my partner want to go 50/50 on a bigger house. My portion of the house will be about $400k, we are going to put my money as 40% down payment, and the other 10% i owe i will use to renovate the house. I also have 400k in tradfi.   One big concern I have is paying capital gains. If i sell my stocks and/or bitcoin I will have to pay significant capital gains. If i take a loan out against my bitcoin,  I will pay 0 taxes. My idea is carry the loan for 6-8 years. Every year i can sell up to 48k capital gains free. So every year starting next year i will sell 48k worth of bitcoin and not pay taxes on it and apply it to my loan till its paid off.   I am not too concerned about getting liquidated on the loan, if the market turns south for a few years cause i can always deposit more bitcoin collateral to keep my LTV below the thresehold. In the meantime time I will rent out my current house and make positive cash flow on that. And then live in the new house mortgage free. (My partner is financing his 50% for himself). So in the meantime time i get one house getting paid for by the renters, plus cash flow. And i get to live in the new house without payment. (We will split utilities, taxes and insurance.)

what would be the dangers of storing your seed phrases online (broken into chunks across multiple different cloud storage platforms),"I am not saying i am going to do this, but want to discuss.  Yes I have my seed phrase on a stamped metal plate somewhere safe in my house that would not easily be found during a smash and grab robbery.  It is not stored online at all.  But I started thinking about the unlikely scenario of :

\-what if I was traveling internationally, and then the flights stopped again.  Covid, terror, ww3, fleeing the country or you don't want to have TSA start rummaging through your stuff.  How to access seed phrase and wealth internationally in one of these low, but real scenarios of you not coming back home?

  
So I started thinking, what are the dangers of storing online.  yes I know storing an entire seed phrase online in one place IS VERY STUPID, but that is not what I am suggesting or asking.  What about doing it tactfully?

\-Like take every third word and split among 3 different cloud storage platforms.  Google Drive, One drive, dropbox, etc.  Words 1 , 4 , 7, 10, etc go onto a doc on one platform.  word 2, 5, 8 go onto another and so on.  There are multiple formulas for doing this across more platforms and some overlap for redundancy.

\-non associated email accounts for each storage platform.

\-no recycled passwords, between accounts

\-no obvious files names ""seed phrase 1 of 3"".  Could even do something unique like write a poem and Bold font the appropriate words so if someone gained access, they wouldn't even know it is a seed phrase.  And even then,  it is only access to 1 of however many accounts you are split across.

So what are the dangers of doing something like this that I might not be thinking of?  The way I see it is potentially getting locked out of an account, but that risk is equally applied to my original scenario...getting locked out of your country.   And there are ways to account for this with overlap as well.

There could be password manager risk.  I use Dashlane and if the attacker got into that, then in theory they could get all further access downstream, but they would really have to know what they are looking for.  Like I said, they would have to know what they are looking for to go find a random word file titled ""poem for my wife"" or some shit like that.   And then they have to do that across multiple platforms and files.   So I weigh that risk as small.

What other risks are there?  

  
Please dont respond ""dude, just memorize your phrase"".  Please also don't respond ""never store your seed phrase online"" because all you did was read Title and you didnt read the actual post.  I am looking for thoughtful discussion here.

Banned from r/buttcoin for engaging in honest dialogue,"I saunter over to the buttcoin reddit every so often to see how other people think and perceive things in different ways than myself. I came across this post:   
""

The less talked about downside of BTC

To me, the real reason BTC is worthless is because it’s a technology created out of thin air that has been duplicated thousands of times with other coins. There is no good reason to believe that in the near or distant future, another similar coin or technology will become the new best thing.

For such a supposedly sought after asset, it has effectively no moat at all. There’s no proprietary secret or IP that can’t effectively be duplicated.   
  
An opinion that is also asking a question, essentially, ""What is stopping another coin/newer tech from replacing bitcoin once that comes along? Why is bitcoin considered to have a moat?"" Since it was a question I answered from what I felt was a neutral and informed place. I thought it cheeky and telling that I was subsequently banned for ""schilling a crypto currency"", labeled a ""ponzi schemer"" and chided about bitcoin's lack of ""utility"" without any way to offer a thoughtful response.   
All in all that is very telling to me about the state of things in many arena's where good faith thought and debate is stifled so as to not ""threaten"" any curated world view's. My original post is below, and I'm sharing here because I even run into bitcoiners who don't quite grasp this important concept:

People do talk about this quite a bit. And the simple answer to that inquiry is that it is a protocol, not a platform.

Protocols tend to stick around. TCP/IP being a great example. Email being another. The wheel is a protocol. So is loading a projectile into a tube and using gunpowder to accelerate its velocity towards a target. Platforms are the iterative expressions of protocols.

What happens then is that protocols are built upon and iterated into the future as technology advances.... and the protocol remains the same. The wheels of today are exceptional compared to the wood wagon, and its still wheel. The guns we have created are nothing like an old musket, and yet they still operate with the same basic protocol. The internet of today is light years incomparable to the early 90's... and yet, same protocol.

You'll hear a great many talk of ""blockchain technology"" as if that might be the protocol and bitcoin is an iterative expression of it. That would be a false conclusion, because blockchain is simply a secure decentralized ledger that solved the byzantine general problem aka double spending. And you can only do that once. Like only discover the wheel once, or figure out guns once, because once you do the problem is solved. And that is what blockchain did and blockchain = bitcoin. They are completely synonymous and utterly the same.

Now, whether or not people find value in a secure decentralized ledger that solves the double spending problem is the question. One might ask what benefits solving that problem bring to ones life? How does solving that problem impact the world in various ways? If one sincerely asks those questions and determines how solving that problem impacts their life, then they can determine how much they would like integrate that solution into their life thus giving it value. And so people then allocate the value they have (or don't allocate) based on their assessment.

And this is where people mostly get off track. Its not about whether one likes or doesn't like bitcoin. Its not about the next thing, or the new tech, or the myspace vs facebook analogy. Its about simply asking if a secure decentralized ledger that solves the double spending problem can bring benefit to your life. As of now, quite a few people have determined that yes it does, and that number seems to be growing by the day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m9zhxh/banned_from_rbuttcoin_for_engaging_in_honest/,True,2025-07-26 17:43:55+00:00,"Error:

BTC market cycle uncertainty must surely lead to many fearing the idea of selling?,"Nobody knows if the 4 year cycle will continue. Many will still bet on that and will likely try sell the top in extreme greed and will try wait for a 50% plus bear market low. But many believe that BTC may break that chain and now begin a slow, steady and somewhat boring rise eventually hitting the same kind of returns as tradfi. 

For those that believe the 4 year cycle is still relevant, will you put your money where your mouth is; play the market by selling when we enter absolute extreme greed, then wait for a tradition BTC correction before jumping back in in what roughly.. 12-18 months time?

How do you keep your seed phrase safe ?,"Hi everyone!

I’m fairly new to the crypto world and recently started investing in BTC on a monthly basis. At first, I was just trying to understand what Bitcoin really is and why so many people value it so highly. Then one day, it just clicked—and now I can’t believe I didn’t see its true value earlier.

As I invest, one of my main concerns is how to securely manage my crypto using a cold wallet. The biggest challenge for me is figuring out the safest way to store my seed phrase.

My initial plan is to write it down on paper and keep it locked in a safe at home. That seems like a good first step, but I know I’ll need backups in case of fire, theft, or any other disaster.

Here’s where I’m stuck: I haven’t found a solution that feels right. Some people suggest splitting the seed phrase and giving pieces to trusted friends, but honestly, I don’t think my friends would prioritize keeping a piece of paper safe for years. Plus, none of them own a safe, so chances are they’d eventually store it digitally, which defeats the whole “cold” concept.

I’ve also read about storing a copy in a bank safe deposit box. While that sounds secure, it feels like it goes against the very principle of Bitcoin—freedom from banks and centralized control. Maybe that’s just me, but I’m buying BTC to secure financial freedom for me and my wife, and to be free from government and banking restrictions.

So, my question is: How do you guys handle this?

Thanks for reading my long post!

Should I build a savings safety net before investing in Bitcoin?,"Hey everyone, I’m still fairly new to Bitcoin and wanted to get some advice from those of you who’ve been in the space longer.

Right now, I’m thinking about investing in BTC, but I also don’t have much in savings.

Respect to those of you who HODL,"I just wanted to pay my respects to the HODLers. Last night, I was having dinner at a restaurant, glass of wine in hand. I’m new to Bitcoin but have invested in the past week. I’m checking my phone every 10-30 seconds, the price, $117.5k…$116.5k…$116k…Sell? Wtf is going on…$115k…..ffs….$114.9k.  Do I sell and cut my losses? Is this going down to $110k? How much will I have lost? I’ve already lost more than the car I decided not to buy. How long will I have to hold to make up for these losses? Maybe I’m just not cut out of this, too much anxiety. I left the bar to run to my car to take some anxiety medication. I convinced myself, it’s only a 2% drop in the first week of ownership, I need to man up and know I’m in it for the long haul and this kind of day is common place. Took another pill to sleep last night. Then today watched it climb back up to the mid $117k’s and caught my breath. FFS, I know there are going to be shit storms, and I’m trying my best over here, but this shit is not easy.

Cheers to you all who have been living this way for the past months/years, mad respect.

Wow, I did not expect this to blow up as it did. First, this wasn’t supposed to be about me, I really just wanted to pay my respects because I can’t imagine what some of you have gone through and am impressed.

Regarding the meds, all good, take them very infrequently.

To those who said I may have invested too much, you’re probably right, I probably invested about 30% too much, just seems silly to leave so much liquidity in the bank when I believe in Bitcoin, but we’ll see how things shake up.

"Long BTC, Short BTC Treasury Companies","The short version of the story is that, for various reasons, market participants are willing to pay roughly $2 for $1 worth of Bitcoin. But that’s only *if it’s held in a publicly traded company.* Weird, right? It’s fascinating because there’s several vehicles to get direct Bitcoin exposure if that’s what you’re actually looking for.  
  
What investors might actually be looking for is crypto exposure + **volatility**. These BTC treasury companies (MSTR as a shining example) move considerably more then the underlying and in some ways “BTC goes up, MSTR goes up even more!” rings true. The reason why people are willing to pay a premium over spot BTC is important, but what I’m really wondering about is whether that premium is **durable**. My hunch, and it’s not much of a stretch, is that over time we’ll see the 2 for 1 ratio trend back towards valuing Bitcoin holdings as a stable-like asset, similar to gold, real estate, etc.

I would also expect that any significant edge here has already been eroded or taken advantage of, but I still like to ponder trades. If there is still an opportunity here, it might be for a few reasons:  


1. The trade is too illiquid to be exploited my larger market players.
2. The trade has a long enough time horizon, that it doesn’t materially outperform buy & hold or other available strategies.
3. The premium is in fact durable and the market will always overpay for “public” bitcoins.

Let’s imagine a scenario where we wanted to put on this trade on. We’ll assume that our Bitcoin treasury companies are just shell companies whose market cap resembles their bitcoin reservers, but trading at a premium. We could

1. Buy $100,000 worth of bitcoin.
2. Short a $100,000 basket of BTC holding companies, weighted by the amount of bitcoins they hold.

If the premium declines from $2, to $1.5 per bitcoin, then the value of our shorts would decline by 50%, leaving us with a $50k profit. Neat. On the contrary, the premium could continue to expand. If for some reason, the market decides that “public market Bitcoins” are now worth $3 instead of $2, our Bitcoin is still worth $100k, but our shorts are now work -$150k and we probably start pondering where we went astray in life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m9jv8g/long_btc_short_btc_treasury_companies/,True,2025-07-26 04:06:45+00:00,"Error:

Seedsigner Iancoleman missmatch,"*I used chatgpt for formatting*

I was testing my SeedSigner build and decided to use a super simple dice roll entropy just for fun. It gave me a 12-word seed, and I figured I’d verify it using Ian Coleman.

So I entered the same entropy into the Ian Coleman tool, and yep — it gave me the same BIP39 seed words. Under BIP84, it even gave me the same zpub as SeedSigner. So far, everything matched up perfectly.

But here’s where it gets weird...

The bc1... receiving addresses shown by Ian Coleman didn’t match the ones shown in SeedSigner.

At first I thought maybe SeedSigner was messing something up. So I tried asking ChatGPT about it, gave it the same seed, and it ended up generating a totally different zpub and addresses (probably using wrong settings under the hood — not helpful).

Then I imported the zpub from SeedSigner into the Nunchuk wallet — and boom, it gave me the exact same bc1 addresses as SeedSigner.

So now I’m kinda stuck.

Same seed → same zpub → but Ian Coleman shows completely different addresses than both SeedSigner and Nunchuk. I double-checked that I had BIP84 selected and was using P2WPKH in Ian Coleman, but the addresses still don’t match.

Is this a known issue with Ian Coleman and native SegWit? Or am I just missing something obvious?

---

TL;DR:

Dice-rolled a test seed in SeedSigner

Verified same seed + zpub in Ian Coleman

But got different bc1... addresses

Nunchuk shows same addresses as SeedSigner

ChatGPT was no help 🤷‍♂️

Now I don’t know who to trust

New to BTC investing - recommendations?,"Hello! I recently started getting into investing a couple years ago. Right now, most of my money is in the market (VGT/VTI/SCHD).

"PSA - if you have ever used any sort of online seed key generator, move your funds asap","Back in 2019, I had gifted a friend $100 in Bitcoin. 

Since it was a small amount, I used an online generator, something like paper wallet Bitcoin, which was apparently at one point legit... But had been bought out.

As time went on, I told my friend that he should look at getting a hardware wallet, since I didn't really trust the method used previously to create the keys. 

Well, he finally got around to looking at it, and it looks like in August last year, the funds were cleared. About $1500 worth. 

I've read many similar stories with similar outcomes. Even if you download a seed key generator and use it offline, it likely isn't generating random keys. It could be generating pre determined keys that the creator has access to. So it could take time, but at the end of the day, the keys are not safe. 

Stick to a hardware wallet, and use a passphrase for the best security. 

Edit: here's another post. Pretty sure used the same site and funds drained around the same time.

The only point of this post is to serve as a public safety notice that if you used any website to generate your seed key, even if it was done ""offline"", and even if it's been years with no issues, it isnt safe.

What if requiring all spending in Bitcoin actually fixes inequality?,"Most of the Bitcoin conversation I see focuses on store of value — save in BTC, protect against fiat debasement, etc. But I’ve been thinking about way to combat wealth inequality as well: what happens if all spending has to happen in Bitcoin? No fiat, no stablecoins — just sats.

If that’s the case, then value has to circulate. You can still hold, but you can’t just extract and sit on the sidelines. Everyone has to participate. That feels like a pretty big shift from the current system, where money flows up and kind of stays there.

I know some Bitcoin maxis talk about hyperbitcoinization, but I don’t hear much about whether forcing BTC to be the only spending layer could actually help reduce inequality — especially if it’s paired with something like a transaction tax and redistribution (UBI, public dividends, whatever). Would BTC even be able to support this or would it need to be built into a different fiat based layer?

Planning to Sell My House for BTC – What Should I Learn or Prepare in the Meantime?,"
I’m planning to sell my house (estimated at ~$700k) and go all-in on Bitcoin. That said, I’m not planning to do it this year — 2025 feels like an ATH year based on the 4-year cycle, so I’m anticipating a meaningful dip in 2026.

The plan is to sell the house in the second half of 2026. Once that happens, I’ll begin DCA into BTC over about 4–5 months — roughly $5k per day until the full amount is deployed.

I’m already aligned with the Bitcoin philosophy and anti-fiat mindset, especially after seeing the scale of government money printing and liquidity injections. But I want to use the time between now and the house sale productively.

What should I read, learn, or study to better prepare for this move?
I’d love recommendations around BTC investing, macroeconomics, risk management, tax strategies, custody, or anything else you think would help someone serious about making this kind of transition.


Ah, I also bought a Ledger and tested it by transferring ~$2,000 between Ledger and Coinbase a few times — I plan to use this setup for self-custody going forward.

Is Bitcoin a ponzi scheme?,"A thread on this debate with AI

https://x.com/bramk/status/1948716799949722050?s=46&t=qgcn_PX5yZYQTNpPAH6jSA

Conclusion by AI:

Hard money like Bitcoin better incentivizes productivity: preserves savings value, rewarding long-term innovation over fiat's inflation-driven consumption/debt cycles. 

Yes, fiat's mandatory nature via legal tender and taxes makes it somewhat involuntary, amplifying Ponzi-like risks without opt-out.

Tax and debasement hit low/middle classes hardest: they rely on wages/savings eroded by inflation, lacking assets to hedge.

bitcoin/coinbase,"I am having difficulty identifying an old email account used to buy bitcoin on coinbase around 2013.  While I still have the bank account I made the purchase with, they don't have records that go back that far.  I do have the account number/routing number used to make the purchase.  Using Agent Ransack, I found evidence that I was at the link below which appears to be evidence of a purchase on one of my old computers.  I recall that I bought around 50 bitcoins (roughly 5.8 million as of my writing this).  When I called their helpdesk, one person said my old email was deleted in 2018 due to being linked to Pakistan (not sure why, as I have never left the states).  The next time I called them the person on the phone denied that email was even on record until they spoke with a supervisor who confirmed it but said that there were no transactions linked to that email...but that doesn't really make much sense to me why I would have opened an account back then but never used it.  I get the sense their helpdesk situation is a mess.

Are they simply trying to hold onto any bitcoin they can?  What happens if they hold it in custody and a person dies and nobody claims it?  It basically stays on their ledger...right?  Is this where a lawyer gets involved?  Could a good computer analyst go through the computer in a deeper dive than I can and pull out all the evidence or maybe find that I used another email account to make the purchase (I did have a few of them I used around that time)?  Would coinbase even be able to identify my account based on my bank routing/account information?  I live in the same house as where I made the purchase so even though the IP address changes regularly, they should also be able to see the location is the same... anyone ever dealt with something similar?  suggestions?

Question about backing up multi-sig wallets vs single-sig,"I see a lot of talk about using multi-sig wallets because they add additional security. We also see a lot of discussion about how to best back up your seed phrases. The thing I don't hear much about is what is best practice for backing up a multi-sig wallet? Just having the seed phrases isn't enough since in a multi-sig setup you also need the xpubs, derivation paths, etc.

Help to choose wallet and secure my crypto.,"Hi, everyone, so I started to buy crypto not long time ago but I want to invest long time, every month I put some money on Coinbase.

 I never put any effort in learn about crypto or exchanges or anything of this at all, and I just learn that technically I own nothing because Coinbase is holding it for me(?), so I learn a little about the wallets and still not fully aware of what I need on my case (cold or hot). 

I hope somebody can share some light on my case. 

Im planning to just buy like 250 per month (I know for some ppl this is little but hey I can't run so I walk)

Im not planning in sell unless is a emergency.

Should I Diversify Beyond Bitcoin for This project ( Social media for Bitcoiners ),"hey Bitcoiners,

Have you heard of Satlantis? It's Aleks Svetski's Nostr project for bitcoiners, travellers and digital nomads and I'm thinking about putting some money into a crowdfunding round they launched at BTC Prague.

Aleks is a author of Bushido of Bitcoin book.

Are any of you looking at this as a project to invest or support?

what I know so far, Beta is live with 2k active users, Backed by Ross Stevens (Stone Ridge), HCM Capital, major launch at BTC Prague 2025.

and going to launch Zap feature means bitcoin Lightning.

I'm normally pretty conservative with my investments - mostly Bitcoin and Gold.

This would be outside my comfort zone but I think there's potential there, and I've seen some early traction.

My gut says social media startups are incredibly risky, but I also want to be part of this somehow and support genuine builders in Bitcoin space. The comparison to early Facebook/Instagram makes me roll my eyes a bit, but I'm trying to be objective.

For those of you who've looked at crowdfunding opportunities or early-stage tech investments, does this seem worth exploring further, or should I stick to what I know?

Of course Bitcoin is a better investment, but this is also about supporting cool projects.

Would you sell SPMO to buy Bitcoin? - for high growth,"I recently allocated a portion of my portfolio for high-growth investments into SPMO (3% of portfolio).   
A few days ago, I invested a lump sum into Bitcoin, which now makes up 10% of my portfolio.

I’m considering whether to reallocate more funds into Bitcoin by selling my SPMO holdings. I’m not concerned about taxes, as I’ve only recently bought into SPMO and haven’t realized any significant gains yet.

Given that this portion of my portfolio is specifically aimed at aggressive growth, I would appreciate your feedback! 

1. Is Bitcoin projected to outperform SPMO over the next 3 to 5 years?
2. Based on that outlook, would you recommend holding onto SPMO or selling it in favor of Bitcoin?
3. What would you personally do, considering the current market trends and future projections?

Bitcoin node download - EXTREMELY SLOW,"Hi all,

So I have a Raspberry PI 5 8GB + a 2TB Samsung T7 external SSD connected via USB 3. The speeds are around 350 MB/S in my tests.

Problem is that everything went fine up to like 0.7x download progress, but now it is so slow that ChatGPT can't even calculate when it's going to be done based on how slow it is. Attached some stats, outputs and settings. (sda is the 2TB drive)

I know that the blockchain download is slow after like 0.6, but at this rate it will finish never, and I don't think it's normal.

15-20 year plan,"I recently started staking a few months ago after taking waaay too long to get on the train. My research on bitcoin, learning as much as I can about it as I can has giving me a hope of an actual retirement some day. I’m a 35yo carpenter and have no benefits to speak of. I have been DCA for a few months, every two weeks( pay day) $200-300 with the goal of $500 a month. I have realized I NEED to not only continue but also double down…When possible… my wife doesn’t seem to fully understand but still supports thankfully. 

My questions for y’all are:
1)Am I crazy for planning a humble retirement with that kind of timeline (15-20yrs) and dca amount?
2) do you have a planned number of years before you call it? Personally if I’m still making money Il still be staking but just curious

What’s the limit?,"Brand new here. Passed up buying at $5k and again and $17k and feel like a complete jackass. Have just begun to dca in. I’m a Middle Aged dude with some cash and am thinking through how / when to reallocate from stocks to btc. 

I get that our fiat monetary system is broken and my dollars are worthless. But what is bitcoin worth?  And what will it be worth?

Market cap of gold seems like a reasonable proxy. Can see btc going higher because of the hard limit, flexibility etc. 

If gold market cap is $23.5 tn that implies $1.1mm for bitcoin today and more in the future as inflation continues. So we have a 9x from here at a minimum?

Living Off Bitcoin Experiment. Update one.,"Hey r/Bitcoin, about a month ago I posted about trying to live off Bitcoin. Most comments called it dumb or said it wouldn’t work due to taxes and fees. I actually agreed, but I’ve found a simple solution that works for me. It’s not perfect, but here’s my plan to start. I will learn as I go and get better I am sure.

The Plan:  
I’m using Strike’s Direct Deposit, Pay Rent, and Pay Bills features. 100% of my paychecks will be converted to Bitcoin on Strike. For expenses, I’ll use credit cards with solid rewards (for example Gemini’s 4% Bitcoin cashback or Prime/Chase for Amazon purchases). So in short I am spending USD that are not mine, and instead of paying off my cards every paycheck like I have been doing my whole life, I'll simply do one payment monthly via Strike’s Pay Bills feature to minimize Bitcoin transfer fees. It won’t eliminate fees entirely but lower them quit a bit, and I’m fine with that. Once I hit a certain amount of Bitcoin on Strike I’ll move my Bitcoin to a cold wallet.

Having 12 payments a year(one a month) via Strike paying off cards, I can use their tax forms to easily fill out taxes. As for income/capital tax, it shouldn't be much but even so it just means Bitcoin went up and I am beating inflation.

Savings:  
I’m converting half my savings to Bitcoin now and the other half over the next 3 months. If this doesn’t work out, I can easily switch my direct deposit back to my bank and convert savings back to USD. 

Why I’m Doing This:  
With Bitcoin hovering around $117-120k, I don’t see it disappearing, and frankly it’s got too much momentum. I’m fed up with my hard earned money losing value and my investments barely outpacing inflation. I’m going 100% into Bitcoin over the next few months. I’ll either sink with the ship or sail to the new world! (lol that was so cheesy).

I wouldn't normally share this info but I have been seeing more interest in doing this exact thing from a lot of people online, some friends, and some family. I hope my journey can help others who are interested and seeing what works and doesn't.

As always I love the discussion and feedback. What do you think? Any tips or flaws I’m missing?

Buy your time back! So that you can experience being YOU!,"Many of us will remain perpetually within the system. 

You go to school, then you rush into college, then your rush into work. Never getting a break. A breather.

Constantly filling up your time with an obligation. Your mind always fixates on whats coming up in your calendar.

And if we see reality both spiritually and energetically. You will have many energetic obligations that will make claim upon your time, energy and consciousness.

On your weekends, you can never really relax. You are forced to cram whatever it is you want to do before your mind remind you that you have to go back to work in a few days.

Many binge watch shows. Some cram in their facourite fast food. Others binge and have a drink.

You never do anything because you actually WANT to do it, but because you have a time based obligation coming up. You have to return to whatever work you are contracted to do. So this little bit of free time is the best time to cram it in. Even if you use company given vacation time, you're still on the clock. Still trying to maximise your days and cram everything in. Still in a state of countdown until the days you have to return.

Your mind does not belong to you.

But when you finally buy your time back. When it's not just a weekend. Or two weeks. 

But when you finally free yourself from any obligations, and the calandar is truly clear. Just empty.

It is then when you actually get your mind back. You realise you can do what YOU actually want to do.

Do you have to cram in the netflix shows? Not really. You only did that becuase your were short on time.

Do you need to get the pizza because it 'friday'? Hmm maybe you'll just get it when you actually want pizza.

Hmm so what should I do today. Maybe read that book that ive always put of reading. You only put it off because it wasn't as fast and as 'important' as the podcast. Because your mind was never on a slow frequency. But amped up on caffein for the unnatural business world.

When you buy your time back. It is so refereshing. Everyday you wake up. Your mind is just clear. There is no energetic obligation. There is nothing in the calendar counting down in the back of your mind. No device you really have to give your attention. No one who can make claim upon you.

Just you. You finally get the time to interact with yourself. Your own mind. Really thinking about all the things you ACTUALLY want to do when you aren't pressed for time.

Many can not even fathom being away from the system. Stepping off the ship. When you are an unemployed teen who has never had a career,. it doesn't feel the same. You still feel as though you are in debt to yourself. You don't feel free.

Many are currently in their careers, with enough financial backing to take a year out of work. But must face the fact that they have never really stepped away from the system which gave them assurance through time. Some idea of stability.

But you must experience you. Having your own mind back. Developing your relationship with time. Developing your relationship with the unknown future. Like stepping off the fiat ship which offers you 'stability'. And for the first time venturing out into the water by yourself. Scary I know.

But everyone must experience what it is like to wake up. And for their to be no energetic obligation for a period of their life.

No worrying about money. No worrying about how your going to pay the rent. No feeling that your going to have to go back to work because money is uncertain.

You don't have to make enough to retire idefinetelty. Just enough so that you can get 6 or even 12 months where its just all clear. Just so you can experience what it like at least once within this lifetime.

To just wake up. And have enough time to just be you, with nothing else in sight.

Since on your calendar. All that will be ahead is, YOU.

Bitcoin gives me hope,"My whole working life I’ve been working my ass off, saving and living a frugal lifestyle.

Price manipulation,"The Price of Bitcoin is being managed and in part manipulated. This is a fact. 
However if think that is a bad thing you may want to reconsider. By managing the market properly they are perpetuating consolidation in the effort to reduce the volatility of the asset thereby increasing the value. 
Reducing volatility brings in more buyers and in the long run reduces the options market which by its nature creates volatility. The options market is sustainable in high volatility. A reserve asset is depreciated by the same action. I would prefer a stable asset to a high volatility options trade any day and every day. Patience has been the hallmark of bitcoin. HODL is the definitive strategy. It is the norm. Now however, it is becoming an even more valuable asset class by eliminating the now unnecessary risk that has plagued the HODLer every four years for almost two decades. This represents maturity in and for the asset class. Enjoy the opportunity to earn money and value by stepping back from the daily grind and taking advantage of the constant, consistent and reliable growth of your portfolio.

Finding Average Cost #,"Apologies in advance if this is a dumb question, but is there any way to determine your average cost of BTC purchases after purchasing from multiple platforms then storing on a hard wallet? 

For context, I began purchasing Btc on coinbase ~5 years ago and switched to River about 2 years ago. I DCA and lump sum, totaling usually about 9 transactions a week. I can obviously see what my average cost in River is at the moment, but when I move that to a hard wallet and start from $0 again in River it resets the average cost too. 

I’d ultimately like to know what my current gains look like from the myriad of BTC purchases at different over the years if possible. I know I’m up overall but it’s hard to tell by how much.

Trezor One Best Android Instructions,"Last October I began buying BTC and purchased a Trezor One during Black Friday sale, but I don't currently have a desktop, only a work Mac that my admin said would be a bad idea to use (even though I am going to purchase it when it's upgraded this fall). 

I know there are plenty of videos, and I purchased the proper cable to attach it to my Android, but I am having trouble understanding how to move my BTC into it. 

If anyone can suggest a resource like a particularly good YouTube video or web site, please let me know. 

I would very much appreciate any other advice such as whether I should just wait until the Mac is my personal property and do it through MacOS, or any other steps I should consider. 

Right now I don't have much, but I am saving to buy more and with the big investors like Blackrock involved now, I want full control of my wallet,regardless of the amount. 

Last questions: when you move it off the exchange (Coinbase), does it show you have a zero balance? 

Would I need to move it back to the exchange in 15-20 years when I plan to sell? 

For anyone willing to take the time to answer any of these questions, thank you.

Most people don’t care,"I got into Bitcoin at the start of the last bull run in late 2020. Like many, I was sceptical at first. I asked all the usual questions, such as:

	- Is this just a pyramid scheme?
	- It’s so volatile, how does it even work?
	- Does it even have any real world use?
	- Isn’t it for criminals?

Etc..

But after a few weeks of doubt and resistance, I started asking the deeper questions, the kind most people here have probably wondered at some point.

	- What actually is money?
	 - How does the current global financial       system really work?
	- Why does it feel like my money buys less every year?
	- How do I protect what I earn from inflation?

Eventually, the penny dropped, and I got to the bottom of the well: I could no longer ignore that the purchasing power of the dollar was eroding fast. Saving in dollars is like trying to fill a leaky bucket. The only logical response is to invest in assets. And when you compare asset classes like property, stocks, and gold, despite its volatility and imperfections, Bitcoin stands out as the clear winner: its the strongest, the most scarce, and the most independent asset we have.

Fast forward to now and I feel like I should be sharing what I’ve learned, encouraging others to ask the same questions I did and hopefully realise this isn’t going anywhere.

But every time I bring it up, I get hit with the same kind of questions and skepticism I had at first. The problem is, most people don’t take the next step. They brush it off without actually understanding what they’re dismissing. When you look closer, their opinions are usually based on a handful of headlines or some outdated assumptions. They’ve made up their minds and haven’t stopped to question if that belief still holds up.

Now I try to stay grounded when confronted with these views. I mean, I’m not pretending to be someone who’s financially savvy or really understands macro economics. But I’ve thought hard about this, I’ve read articles and listened to ALOT of podcasts. And so when listening to these critics, I try to understand where they’re coming from. I try to let go of my need for confirmation bias, and to listen to the opposing view. But upon asking deeper questions, these views are usually not considered. 

Even some friends I’ve talked to who are extremely well off and very knowledgeable investors have completely dismissed the idea as a “scam” that’s “too good to be true”. 

Honestly, I think we’re watching a weird social  phenomenon unfold, a mix of cognitive dissonance, a lack of critical reasoning and a social conformity to not wanting to be the first ones out on the limb. People don’t want to face the idea that their view of bitcoin might be a little outdated. Once they get a belief confirmed by one source or two sources, it becomes set in stone. Even when you offer clear, rationale evidence and answers to their questions, they laugh it off, or ignore it, or label it a scam without even questioning their reasoning. They don’t question their assumptions, or even how the current system works, or why eggs now cost $8 to $10 when just a few years ago they were half that.

 I’m mostly just venting to a community that probably gets the pain of trying to talk about Bitcoin with the people around them. The sad part is, even when people are handed a ticket to the moon, most will come up with a hundred reasons not to take it. They’ll stay on the launchpad, arms crossed, watching the rockets leave. And by the time they finally want a seat, those tickets will be rare… and priced accordingly.

I know I should probably just leave people to figure it out for themselves, but after having someone else who insisted I understand how bitcoin works and why it’s important, I feel somewhat obligated to spread the message. 

I’m sure most of you have encountered similar experiences. Any tips for orange pilling people? Or is a lost cause, and just a case of the ones who get it get it, and the ones who don’t don’t.

Honestly, I wasn't even surprised.

It seems like the excitement around Bitcoin has changed. ETFs have quietly built up huge holdings. Big companies have started keeping Bitcoin in their reserves without making noise about it. Even hotel chains and smaller businesses have joined in, silently buying in the background. But regular people mostly stood by, unsure if even $60K was already too expensive.

It feels like big institutions finally figured it out. They didn't talk loudly or create hype.. they just quietly bought Bitcoin. Most regular investors didn’t even notice.

For the first time since I got involved with Bitcoin, I felt ordinary holders like us were being left behind. It's as if the rules suddenly changed, but nobody told us.

Is anyone else noticing how quiet regular investors have become? Did we just watch Bitcoin turn into something owned mainly by corporations overnight?

Curious to hear if you feel the same way ?

Still good with CGT,"I live in a country with no capital gains tax but realised capital gains in crypto are taxed as income.  So if I buy a share in a company for $100 and it increases to $200, and I sell, there is no tax to pay.  But if I buy $100 of BTC and sell at $200, I’ll owe $39 in tax on the sale.

Bitcoin Wallet Keys vs UTXO Keys,"Hello, can someone please help me understand how these work?

For example, if I plug in my Trezor and say ""restore from key phrase"" and type in 16 random words.

So while theoretically the chance to guess the key to sign an existing UTXO is infintesmally small, because you'd have only 1 right answer, isn't the chance to guess the key to a signing device (wallet) MUCH higher because there are millions of wallets?

So as Bitcoin adoption grows, doesn't the chance of guessing wallet keys become more viable?

Anti-Bitcoin op-ed in Bloomberg,"I guess we're still pretty early if professional economists can get paid to write things like this:

>**Bitcoin in Your 401(k)? That’s Not a Risk I Would Take**  
*As they enter the financial mainstream, cryptocurrencies present both investors and consumers with new kinds of dangers.*  
  
I have [long been](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-26/bitcoin-etf-crypto-is-going-mainstream-which-means-it-s-over) a [crypto skeptic](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-11/burned-by-crypto-don-t-learn-the-wrong-lesson), but as it worms [its way into](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/white-house-readies-order-to-bring-private-equity-to-401-k-s) America’s [financial infrastructure](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-18/trump-signs-stablecoin-bill-delivering-win-for-crypto-industry), it is getting harder and harder for me to maintain the argument that it will crash and burn. So I have revised my opinion. Crypto does have a future – as a speculative asset that enhances risk for gamblers, the paranoid, and less sophisticated investors, all the while diverting capital from more productive uses.  
  
See? I told you I had changed my mind.  
  
Something about crypto has never sat well with me. It contradicts everything I understood about money: It is [volatile](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-11-12/trump-win-doesn-t-completely-explain-the-bitcoin-bubble) and hard to use, and it solves a problem there is already a better solution for: Government-issued money is pretty great. Even stablecoins, which could become a viable means of payment with new federal regulation authorized by the law President Donald Trump signed last week, can’t match the dollar.  
  
Yes, blockchain technology may prove to be a good alternative to the clunky and flawed payments system. Crypto is also a useful currency for anyone engaging in illegal transactions or living in a country experiencing hyperinflation. But these use cases do not begin to justify the price of Bitcoin, let alone all the other cryptocurrencies.  
  
But I have learned to let all that go and accept crypto’s existence. Markets [are weird sometimes](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-03-25/trust-the-data-not-always-but-you-should-still-use-it), and they can stay weird for a long time.  
  
What bothers me is this: If you look at the long history of financial disasters, they always start the same way. There’s an asset or strategy sold as risk-free, yet it also manages to deliver above-market returns. That should be a bright red flag that something is wrong and will end badly. It is the hard truth of markets: Bigger rewards can come only from taking more risk. Yet crypto’s defenders will say it is the ultimate hedge against the collapse of the dollar and possibly the entire US economy – and yet it is also priced as a very risky asset. This makes me uneasy.  
  
As crypto enters the mainstream, however, my worries are changing. I see three potential futures.  
  
One is that – my revised opinion notwithstanding – crypto will collapse after all, and the price will go to zero or something close to it. Trump is readying an executive order [to allow it](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/white-house-readies-order-to-bring-private-equity-to-401-k-s) in people’s 401(k) plans, and even if it is [blessed by the SEC](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-17/sec-to-weigh-innovation-exception-tied-to-crypto-atkins-says), there is always a risk that a speculative asset with no intrinsic value will crash. If that’s the case, these last 15 years will be remembered as a weird quirk of financial history. The regulatory law Trump signed last week makes this scenario less likely, since there is now a population of captive buyers.  
  
Another, more likely scenario is that crypto is here to stay. It will be mostly owned by investors who want lots of risk in their portfolio; those who are financially naïve; and those who [distrust both the government](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w31284/w31284.pdf) and the global financial system and believe there is a non-trivial probability it will all collapse. (There could be significant overlap in all these groups.) These investors think cryptocurrencies offer a hedge and will allow them to profit from a world in which the US economy collapses and yet they still somehow have internet service.  
  
It is impossible to estimate how many of these people there are, but there are a lot. They already prop up a decent chunk of the gold market – another asset that is supposed to be safe but is actually quite volatile.  
  
There is no financial calamity here. But it is not a benign scenario, because there is a lot of capital going to an asset that does not serve the economy in any real way. Speculating on crypto is not like investing in a company that makes things. This means there will be less capital funding the real economy, instead going toward something that is effectively [a collectible](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://aswathdamodaran.substack.com/p/the-bitcoin-boom-asset-currency-commodity-17-10-24), in that its primary value is its limited supply.  
  
The third scenario is that, despite everything, this all goes well. Perhaps the dollar will collapse, and we will all start using cryptocurrencies for everyday transactions. Maybe stablecoins will [overcome their issues](https://archive.is/o/oLFu8/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-10/stablecoins-bring-crypto-closer-to-the-mainstream-what-could-go-wrong) and replace the credit-card and banking industries. Maybe some other use case will emerge.  
  
If any of that happens, all those people who put their 401(k) in crypto will be vindicated. It’s possible, I suppose. But I wouldn’t bet on it.

23M investing in bitcoin,"Hi there,

Not too familiar with the bitcoin scene, just know I should be atleast starting to invest it in sooner rather than later.

Income is roughly around 105k NZD per annum. Usually save roughly 2-3k per month after expenses. Single no kids, renting on my own. I already invest into a hatch account which has a portfolio of 1k in eft’s etc 

Couple of questions:

1) where do I buy bitcoin 

2) how much should I realistically be buying every week/fortnight/ month. Not trying to beat the market as in the long run it will increase (hopefully)

Regret,"Surely I can't be the only one. 

Back in 2014/15 I had a settlement from a court case and I had about 15k in my hands. 

I had some debt to pay, so I wasn't able to use all 15k but I had wanted to purchase some more BTC. I had already been involved in the crypto scene and trading on Poloniex for a year or so. I fully intended to purchase 15 BTC worth about $9k at the time. 

I distinctly remember having a conversation with my friend at the time who suggested that I buy silver or at least a somewhat safer investment at the time. 

I don't think I did really wanting with the money other than live on it. I've not always been bug in the earnings department for whatever reason. 

But here I am 10 years later lamenting that I didn't stick by my guns and buy those 15 BTC. 

Even assuming I had gotten rid of 7 of them along the way, I would have over $800k in a wallet somewhere and the stress of daily living would be mitigated by my BTC reserves. 

How do other forward thinkers that were unable to act on their ideas deal with this loss of potentially life changing situation? 

I literally stand in the shower and almost cry at least once a week because I don't have what I thought I would.

Premium-free put options for interest-free loans,"Disclaimer: this is only really designed for people looking to spend from some of their Bitcoin.

Gold Supplyo,"Most people (especially anti-Bitcoin peeps) seem to think gold is already a fixed supply alternative.

The above ground supply of gold increases at about 2% per year and we don’t know what the total supply is below ground.  Supply roughly doubles every 50 years and quadruples every 100.  And that doesn’t factor in fluctuations due to supply elasticity.

Gold is about the best money outside of Bitcoin, but those tokenomics (sic) put it at a distant second.

I Don't Know if I'm The Only One Taking BTC Future To This Extent,"I used to live in a house that was way too big for me. Too many rooms, too much space, and honestly, too much to maintain. Over time, I started asking myself if I really needed all of it.

At first, I thought about fixing it up or maybe just holding on to it, but it didn’t feel right anymore. The space felt empty, and the cost of keeping it didn’t make sense with how I actually lived.

I was there for almost two years and i have no intention of bringing someone as a wife anytime soon. So i just decided to sell the house which i did, I didn’t buy another house or put the money into something traditional. I decided to buy Bitcoin. I made sure I bought Enough to make it count. After seeing more potential in it than leaving money locked up in a house that didn’t suit me anymore.

After moving into a smaller apartment that feels more like home. easier to manage, and I even use part of the profit to fix things up just to keep life running smoothly.

It feels like I traded something heavy for something lighter. With Less pressure. Some people were criticizing my move. But for me, i feel safer and comfortable this way.

Help me understand how 100% of income into Bitcoin in works with taxes,"I know each country is different, but somehow someway some here on reddit are having 100% of their income (not just savings) into Bitcoin. 
I am interested in how this makes financial sense because when it comes time to pay taxes you would be paying short term capital gains tax on what you were using to pay for groceries, housing, and every other living expense. Why would it make sense to be paying more taxes on what you are spending for living expenses?
In the people I've talked to they use something like BitPay so they have a debit card that sells Bitcoin to pay others in fiat.
The dollar earned in income is taxed and then would be taxed again when you need to pay for something.
I definitely would like to have 100% my income to towards Bitcoin instead of into fiat.... I just would like some clarity on how some of you guys do this. Is there something better than bitpay?

I helped a guy convince his girlfriend to invest in Bitcoin,"I was on vacation last month, sitting at an outdoor bar and listening to a guy excitedly talk about Bitcoin to his girlfriend. She was genuinely interested and asking insightful questions, not just humoring him. I turned my head sideways a couple times before finally turning all the way around and saying ""I'm sorry, I've been listening in, do you mind if I joined you?"" The guy instantly goes ""yes please, I need help here."" 

For around 20 mins, the two of us bounced back and forth about why Bitcoin is the future and she seemed a bit surprised and entertained. When she got up for a drink, he said he hadn't met another bitcoiner in person, which I hadn't either. He said they'd been together for a few years (both mid 20s) and he saw a future with her so this was important. When she got back, she asked a couple more questions then said ""I have $10K to invest right now, I think I'm ready.""

Since ive read couple of storys,"In 2013, it was the first time someone told me to buy Bitcoin.
He was a genuine, nerdy guy. We studied business informatics.

For me, Bitcoin was just a currency used on the deep web to buy hitmen, guns, drugs, etc.
For him, Bitcoin was already what it is to us now. He understood it, and I just said, “Yeah, whatever.”

I mean... decentralized money, power to the people, peer-to-peer network, only a limited amount of Bitcoins available… what the fuck should he know. 

Keep in mind, he told me this while we were just going to grab something to eat. My Goal was a Cheeseburger with large Fries.... Not bitcoin Nonsens. 
He begged me to at least invest 10 euros into Bitcoin.

If I will hold onto that 10 euros, I’d be set for life according to him.
I don’t remember exactly what I said back then, but I know I didn’t do it.
A couple of years later, he vanished. No social media, nothing.

I would have probably sold it couple weeks later since i was broke.... but the universe at least tried to give me a sign... a big sign indeed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m77igf/since_ive_read_couple_of_storys/,True,2025-07-23 12:09:35+00:00,"Error:

That year, I came across a story on Reddit about a guy who had his laptop stolen while traveling abroad. He lost everything — passport, documents, even the BTC he was storing locally. The comments were full of sympathy but not a lot of help, so I DMed him and said, “I can’t do much, but I can send you a little something if it helps you get back on your feet.”

He was shocked. I sent the BTC. I didn’t think twice about it.

We kept in touch for a while. He used the money to get temporary lodging and a new laptop. Eventually, he found work again.

Bitcoin Could Reach $160k–$200k This Year (Based on M2 Liquidity Trends),"Just watched this analysis on how macro liquidity (M2 money supply) correlates with Bitcoin performance. Historically, BTC tends to rise \~90% for every 10% increase in M2. Right now, global M2 is pushing to new highs.

Bitcoin often lags equities by \~3 months, so we could be entering that window now. Based on this, the video projects BTC could potentially hit $160k–$200k by year-end if the macro trend plays out.

Should i go from a 20 word to a 12 word seed?,"Hello everyone,

I got into bitcoin last year and without much research i ended up with a Trezor 3 Hardwarewallet. When i set it up it suggested a 20 word SLIP 39 setup. The more i learn about bitcoin the more i am worried that my wallet is not on a BIP39 Standard (12/24 words).

So if i understand this correctly, if Trezor goes out of business i can't use other hardwarewallets to recover my wallet, right?

I don't really want to transition because i already have the seed on a metal sheet and in my head.

How many of you use the 20 word seed from trezor? Do you think i worry too much?

Buying only 1€ worth of Bitcoin every day,"Recently I started buying just 1€ worth of bitcoin every day and this got me thinking... why doesn't everybody do this?

Obviously it is better to buy as much bitcoin as possible but even if you are a sceptic and do not believe in bitcoin the average person can afford to spend 1 euro or 1 dollar every day. Literally anybody can do this it is easy. You don't need to care about the price, you are buying every day no matter what and all you are doing is stacking sats. This isnt a big risk aswell because all you risk is a single euro or dollar every day. This is an amount people can afford to lose.

1 euro a day is only 30 euros a month or 365 euro a year but what matters is the sats aquired which will get more and more valuable.

Self-custody recovery & inheritance capabilities are LIVE in Electrum wallet,"Hi all, I’m the co-founder of RITREK, the company behind this new feature, AMA.

Proud that RITREK’s work is now part of the wallet that started my Bitcoin journey.

Electrum wallet now includes our plugin for recovery & inheritance of self-custodied bitcoin - without giving up control or trust a 3rd party.

Self-custody is only freedom if it’s recoverable.

We’re getting there.

**Why does this matter?**  
True financial sovereignty means you control your bitcoin-not just while you’re alive, but also if something happens to you.  
Yet, most Bitcoiners have no reliable plan for recovery or inheritance.  
That gap has left many at risk of permanent loss.

**How does it work?**  
We designed a simple, user-controlled system with 2 pre-signed transactions.  
They’re created upfront, stay offline, and only broadcast if needed.

**What does this unlock?**  
It lets you set up a secure, flexible plan to transfer bitcoin to trusted destination - but only if necessary.  
You keep full control today, with a safety net for the unexpected.  
This is a meaningful step toward making self-custody truly resilient and reliable, like it should be. Curious? I’m happy to chat - DMs and replies welcome.

Currently timing a $30K buy to bring my holdings to exactly 1 BTC,"Bought .75 BTC in 2019 when price was around $6-7000. Recently been thinking it would be nice to increase my holdings to a whole coin because, why not? I'm convinced that the upside potential is promising. Just this afternoon, I positioned ~$32K and it's ready to deploy. My initial thought was just to place a market order for the whole purchase, regardless of price. I mean, who cares if I buy at $119K or $120K, right. Or, I could DCA over a month, or a week, or even a day. In the scheme of things, I know it's not a big deal, but does anyone have thoughts on how to optimize this purchase?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m6wn64/currently_timing_a_30k_buy_to_bring_my_holdings/,True,2025-07-23 01:47:03+00:00,"Error:

"I turned down a $1,500 payment in Bitcoin in 2015. Today, it would be worth over $..... Never mind","Back in 2015, I was a new immigrant in a new country, hustling to make ends meet by flipping used computers.

I had this one regular customer who was buying a lot of hardware from me. For one sale, which came to $1,500, he asked if he could pay me in something called ""Bitcoin."" I'd never heard of it and it sounded sketchy, so I turned him down and asked for cash.
He offered to pay in Bitcoin for several other sales after that, and I refused every single time. Looking back, given the amount of gear he was buying, he was almost certainly using the laptops for BTC mining.
At the time, that $1,500 payment would have been about 5 BTC.

Today, those 5 BTC would be worth over.... Never mind

It’s a tough lesson in how fear of the unknown can make you miss a huge opportunity.

The truth is that I don't think about it anymore...

Refinance your Toyota to accumulate more Bitcoin?,"Dear Bitcoiners, I'm doing some research for RWA on/with Bitcoin. I know many of you prefer the peace of mind of not having payments, but if you're already paying for something monthly or eying an upgrade, I'd like to explore refinancing that for you, interest-free, zero-down.  
  
The catch: what's your worst case for BTC in 4 years / do you care?  
  
Would love some responses with:  
\- your monthly payment  
\- your rate

In summary, if you provide cashflow and downside protection against the 4-year price of BTC, you could have MSTR playbook for your own business and assets. This could then be used towards home ownership as well without selling BTC.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m6m9k7/refinance_your_toyota_to_accumulate_more_bitcoin/,True,2025-07-22 18:38:51+00:00,"Error:

The year - 2039. Bitcoin city has closed migration to all holding less than 0.5 BTC,"It’s 2039.

Today I spent three hours trying to send a food request to the state nutrition portal. The server timed out eight times. My building still runs on a patched DSL line that hooks into something resembling a modem from 2003. It whines like a dying animal every time you try to connect. Sometimes I think it is dying.

We were once the richest country in the world.

Now we’re borrowing servers from collapsed states and patching our infrastructure with leftover copper wire. Power grids are rationed. Public transport has become a myth. Roads are undriveable. Even corporations can’t upgrade anything—they can barely maintain payrolls, let alone invest in development. Inflation didn’t just break the currency—it erased any hope of future planning.

No one saves. No one builds. We all wait.

But 300 miles east, surrounded by walls of brushed titanium and AI-guided defense turrets, sits Bitcoin City.

Population: exactly 1,000,000.
Currency: sats only.
Mayor: Michael Saylor.

They don’t even speak about “money” there anymore. It’s all sats. Everything from vending machines to real estate is priced in satoshis. Thanks to the 13th-gen Lightning Network, employers pay by the second. You can literally clock in, work for 42 minutes, and get paid 11,820 sats in real time. No bank. No waiting. No inflation.

It’s not just fast—it’s beyond fast.
It’s final.
It’s truth.

They say the network is so efficient now that you could pay for a drone-delivered avocado toast in 10 milliseconds, and it would confirm before the toast hits your plate. Autonomous contracts, smart locks, AI market integrations—all built on Lightning. It’s not a city. It’s a protocol with buildings.

Meanwhile, outside the walls?

A single egg costs $75.
One gigabyte of mobile data costs $9.50.
And real meat is more myth than memory. 96% of the population now eats government-issued lab gel infused with vitamins and sedatives. Tastes like chalk and battery acid.

Inside Bitcoin City, they host “Egg Auctions” every spring. A box of twelve pasture-raised eggs just sold for 890 sats. That’s ₿0.00000890, or around $0.45 in today’s BTC terms.

Egg prices in sats keep going down every year. It’s become a meme in the city — “When Eggflip?” they joke, watching the fiat world crumble from their climate-controlled towers.

You can’t just move there.

After BTC crossed $3 million, Bitcoin City closed its gates for good. You needed 0.5 BTC to apply. Now? That’s $2.5 million—if you could even find someone to sell it to you. You can’t fake sats. You can’t inflate them. You can’t beg your way in.

Mayor Saylor’s private army — the Sovereign Guard — is larger and better equipped than most standing nations. Every soldier’s salary is pegged to time and sats. No corruption. No bureaucracy. Just mission and math.

They say the city runs like a living machine.
They say the people inside don’t even understand what “monthly paycheck” means anymore.
They say kids there don’t cry from hunger.

I haven’t seen a real bird in years.
But sometimes, when the wind shifts just right, I swear I can smell toast and coffee drifting over the walls.

Bitcoin City isn’t the future.
It was the escape hatch.

What adoption strategy is missing and/or underdeveloped for Bitcoin?,"Just as a thought experiment, can you share what you think is missing in Bitcoin that if present would drive faster adoption?  I think it is worth revisiting this topic from time to time. 

Items such as:

1) a tax policy 
2) a technical feature 
3) improved financial incentives either short or long term for mining as an example
4) govt adoption for paying taxes/fees or for tracking govt spending itself
5) financial literacy training 
6) better regulatory environment on what specifically? 


7) anything you can think of


This is just a brainstorming session. I saw an ad for a credit card that earns bitcoin with every purchase and I thought, I want that cc. But then I thought it probably is a minuscule percentage or has other gimmicks. 

It would be mildly rationale for businesses to offer 5-10% discounts for paying with bitcoin since holding generates ~30% returns / yr on avg.

Had a moment of weakness... then a moment of clarity. HODL for life. 🚀,"Started my Bitcoin journey at the beginning of 2025. I finally took the time to understand what Bitcoin really is, *why* it's valuable, and most importantly—how to store it properly. Once it all clicked, I jumped in with a lump sum and have been slowly stacking ever since.

Then the run to the new ATH happened.

For a brief moment, I saw the profit I could take out. It was enough to cover this year’s holiday—free money for doing nothing. I even moved the Sats from cold storage to the exchange.

But right before clicking ""sell""... it hit me.

It might take me *years* to get back to this amount of Bitcoin again. A small gain now could mean missing out on something truly life-changing down the line. That holiday would be nice—but that’s not the point. That’s not *why* I’m here.

Bitcoin has taught me patience, long-term thinking, and what real value looks like. So I reversed course, sent it all back to cold storage, and smiled.

Still going on holiday. Just not on Bitcoin's tab.

Taxes question,Let’s say I daily DCA on an app like strike. I don’t sell for ten years. During that time strike disappears and I’m forced to use another exchange.  What happens to my cost basis history if I no longer have access to  strike.  How are people safeguarding against an event like this?  Do they save yearly reports issued by the exchanges on a flash drive or something? Also since IRS now gets yearly copies of all transactions could you technically contact IRS a decade later and request copies of these yearly reports if needed?  I haven’t started with bitcoin yet because of all the what ifs.  If I daily DCA that’s a lot of cost basis values and when I go to sell how would I even calculate all that. Seems like a headache to me. I may just wind up doing the bitcoin ETFs. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m642qx/taxes_question/,True,2025-07-22 03:54:47+00:00,"Error:

Can someone explain benefits to holding actual BTC vs ETF?,"First of all, I am a bitcoin investor for purely financial reasons, and while the ideology of BTC decentralization and monetary exchange free from government sounds appealing, I believe in BTC and invest in it purely as a digital hedge to currency and inflation, like a new Gold in steroids. Bitcoin is also maturing as it becomes less correlated to the US stock markets. Most of the BTC bull/bear markets prior to the last 18 months can be described as profits/losses from financial markets dumping in/out of BTC to fuel a trade across another asset. I.e sell stock gains and buy crypto, or stocks crash and sell crypto to buy the dip. Inflation and geopolitical crisis in 2022 was a great opportunity for BTC to shine, but it was still too correlated to the markets and underperformed. Now, with extended inflation, possibly stagflation, and US tariff hikes, the correlation to US stock market appears to be weakening and BTC is becoming more appealing as both an inflation hedge and independent market.

I’ve been able to purchase a sizeable amount of FBTC via my brokerage, far more than I would be willing to purchase actual BTC via a crypto exchange/wallet. The FBTC expense ratio was 0% for the first few months, and now 0.25%, which I would argue beats the fees associated with purchasing actual BTC. Fidelity holds custody of the actual BTC, and claims 98% of the BTC is held in cold storage. That means I don’t have to worry about managing a wallet or saving private keys. In the event this BTC were to be stolen from Fidelity, there would likely be far more regulatory pressure to protect asset losses of the ETF based on financial regulation, and far more investigative resources directed at recovering the BTC than the little guy getting scammed from their bitcoin wallet on a crypto exchange.

Exchanges must be super generous for selling us the next trillion-dollar asset…,"Can someone help me understand this?

When we buy Bitcoin, we’re basically exchanging our “weak dollars” for someone else’s Bitcoin.  But a lot of that Bitcoin is held by exchanges, who act as the middleman.

If Bitcoin (or any crypto) is expected to rise massively in value over time, why wouldn’t these exchanges just hold onto it instead of selling it?  They’ve got the resources and infrastructure couldn’t they just buy up most of the supply and control the digital gold rush themselves?

Anyone here using Crypto.com’s on-chain wallet? Got a few questions.,"Hi everyone ☺️


Looking to get some real user feedback on Crypto.com’s wallet (aka on-chain wallet).

How secure do you actually find it?

If you’re not a fan – what put you off? What do you use instead?

And for those who do use it – how much (roughly, % wise) of your exchange holdings do you keep in there, and why?

Trying to figure out how much I trust it long-term and really appreciate any insights!

Bitcoin is a gateway,"Bitcoin is not like a stock, a gold bar, or real estate. This form of money that I love is not valuable because of what it can 'do' in the same sense as what gold can do when sold as a commodity or real estate when it is developed into farmland or what-have-you.

To me this is valuable because of what it 'is'. It is the gateway to a future where people are able to live free of banks. 

I know that sounds a little crazy, but I don't think I am alone in recognizing this.

If Bitcoin never went up from here, I would still be buying it. It isn't a hype for me. (Of course I know it is going to go up because the US Dollar can't stop loosing its purchasing power.)

Finally pulled the trigger. Allocating 5% to Bitcoin for the long haul.,"After months of lurking on here and doing my own research, I've finally decided to jump in and allocate 5% of my portfolio to Bitcoin.

It feels like the right amount of exposure for me. I'm a big believer that we're still in the early days of crypto adoption, and I want to have some skin in the game. Seeing giants like Blackrock and Fidelity get on board really feels like a signal that things are shifting fundamentally. Plus, the simple idea of a fixed supply (only 21 million ever) in a world where money is constantly being printed just makes sense to me.

My thinking is that 5% is the magic number where I can sleep well at night even if it goes to zero, but I'll still get some real upside if the adoption story continues to play out.

The plan is just to DCA in consistently from here on out. I'm not smart enough to time the market, so I'm not even gonna try.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m5zjky/finally_pulled_the_trigger_allocating_5_to/,True,2025-07-22 00:15:05+00:00,"Error:

"I think I bought some Bitcoin back in 2012, but I can't find any records of it. Any help or ideas appreciated!","Edit: apparently my wallet experience must have occurred after 2012, and more likely in 2013 or after. (Thank you fellow redditors)

Apologies in advance if you've read other sad sob stories like mine before. ""...sure pal, sure you bought some Bitcoin, yeah right!"" but I swear it may have happened. I've searched before, back when it first hit around $20k in 2017 and everyone was freaking out, but having found nothing at the time, I gave up. Now that we're well over $100k per coin I'm giving it another go. Once again, I'm wracking my brains to figure out if I can find any trace of the records of what I did back in 2012. Maybe you can help me. Here's what I remember:

I remember downloading a coin wallet on my smart phone at the time, (pretty sure it was my phone and not my computer. But I over think and my memory is fuzzy.) Anyway I remember it was quite a tedious process, and I had to provide a copy of my driver's license to authentic it, etc. I can't remember if I linked my bank to the app though.

I distinctly remember writing down a copy of my seed phrase on a piece of paper. (What a funny combination of words!) Because the wallet app said not to keep a digital copy of it anywhere for safety. I have looked and looked for that damn piece of paper everywhere and can't find it. (And I have a lot of old papers and records!) Does a seed phrase mean I bought Bitcoin? Or does it just come with the wallet? I'm thinking the latter.

I remember looking at the price of the Bitcoin, and thinking it wasn't that expensive, ($13?) but also thinking ""why should I buy this? What can I even buy with it? A freaking pizza?"" (There was a pizza place near me that advertised that it accepted Bitcoin, but no other businesses that I knew at the time did.)

And that's where my memory kind of goes blank. I don't remember if I actually bought any coins, or if I did, how many. It's driving me nuts. Both my mom and a sibling tell me they remember me telling them I bought some Bitcoin back in the day. Maybe it's just wishful thinking on their part? And again, if I did it, why can't I remember buying it???

I was an early adopter of Gmail, and my email address predates this 2012 time frame, and yet when I do a Gmail search for any old email that has the key words ""wallet"" or ""coin"" or ""Bitcoin"" I don't see any emails confirming my wallet download or any transactions. Maybe I deleted those email ""receipts"" long ago?

Ideas: Check all my old bank records from around 2011-2013 to see if there was any transfer of funds to a wallet of some sort. (unfortunately I don't bank with them anymore but maybe I could figure out how to access the old records anyway?) 

Check all my old phones again (I have a bunch of old cell phones and smart phones but I looked at them all back in 2017 and didn't find any wallets then.)

Check any old hard drives from old computers I owned at the time (again, I've saved many old hard drives from past desk tops and even gave a hard drive adapter/reader device to access them.)

Somehow do a deeper search on my Gmail for any old emails about a Bitcoin transaction?

Go through every box of paperwork and records I have, pages of every book in my library, and any possible other place I might have stashed that piece of paper with my seed phrase on it!

Anything else I can do? Any of your thoughts and ideas would be appreciated. After this search I will give up.

Did Bitcoin inspire a “memecoin” as early as 2011?,"While digging through some archived posts on Reddit, I came across a user active in the r/Bitcoin community back in 2011 who called himself Mitsubishi Goldstein. He proposed a satirical crypto project—a blockchain backed by humor rather than utility—calling it “lolcoin.”

The idea was never fully realized, but it’s interesting to see that even in Bitcoin’s earliest days, people were already riffing on the concept of value and trying to push it to absurdist limits.

This user also ran a niche website focused on crypto-related humor, showing just how deep early engagement in the community went—even in unexpected directions.

It made me reflect on how much the culture around Bitcoin has changed, and how some of these early voices had creative, if unserious, ideas that predated what would eventually become an entire memecoin movement years later.

Just thought I’d share in case anyone else finds early crypto history as fascinating as I do.

"Bitcoin ETFs Are Driving Institutional Accumulation, But Retail Seems Absent, Is That Bullish or Bearish?","Since the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs, we have seen steady inflows from institutions, with BlackRock, Fidelity, and others collectively holding over 800K BTC. Yet, Google Trends and wallet activity suggest retail interest remains low, even after the halving.

Institutional narrative: Long-term holders are winning. ETFs simplify exposure and reduce volatility.

Retail absence: Some argue it’s bullish (dry powder left), others say it’s bearish (no FOMO = no hype cycle).

Glassnode data: SOPR and ASOL metrics indicate coins are moving with profit taking, but without signs of full blown euphoria.

1. Do you think this ETF driven accumulation without retail hype can sustain a bull market?

Lloyds Bank confiscated £600 received from a transfer — traced to Binance — what can I do?,"Hi all,

I’m hoping someone here can advise.

I received a £600 bank transfer to my Lloyds Bank account. The transfer came directly from another UK bank account (not from Binance itself), but I had actually arranged this withdrawal via Binance — I assume Binance used an intermediary or third-party service.

A couple of days later, Lloyds froze the transaction and removed the funds, stating that the money originated from a source reported as fraudulent.

When I called support, they simply said the transfer was flagged and that I should ""contact the sender"" — but in this case, I initiated everything via Binance, so I don’t have a direct contact.

Has anyone had this happen before? Is there any legal route I can take to appeal this or get my money back?

Irrational Exuberance,"I read the Bitcoin Standard, which makes a very convincing argument for Bitcoin being a superior form of money and a great store of value.  I believe both are true, so I dollar cost average by direct deposit every biweekly paycheck, $114, and will keep that up for many years to come.

However, it seems to me that people in this sub are unrealistically and overly optimistic about the size of likely future returns, and the lack of risk involved.  It is natural for a subreddit like this to become something of an echo chamber, which makes this problem worse.  So I am sure this will be unpopular, but I would like to temper people’s expectations with some reality.

The 100% annualized returns of the past are very unlikely to continue indefinitely.  Bitcoins market cap in 2011 was about $32.1 million, which gave a lot of room to grows to today’s level of about $2.36 trillion.  For that process to repeat itself over the same time frame, it would require Bitcoin to reach a market cap of around $173 quadrillion.  The total M2 money supply, stock exchange capitalization, gold and cryptocurrency combined, is estimated to be around $210 trillion.  For this kind of growth to be possible, would both require Bitcoin to take over nearly all of that, and for that total value to skyrocket.  

I suppose that’s not completely impossible, but it sure strikes me as incredibly unlikely.  Much more likely, the price appreciation starts to slow at some point, and eventually falls much closer in line with returns of traditional investments, which are quite good.  However, this also isn’t guaranteed, it could underperform things like the stock market.  

There are many potential risk factors, including government regulation, or perhaps the best case scenario of government fiscal responsibility, prompted by the pressure of an alternative like bitcoin.  Global instability, future wars with AI could be devastating to the systems we use to maintain the blockchain.  There is undoubtedly a much longer list of potential risk factors, but it is absolutely not guaranteed things work out great for Bitcoin price appreciation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m5e9ng/irrational_exuberance/,True,2025-07-21 09:24:11+00:00,"Error:

How come so much of this block's projected Tx's were omitted?,"There are plenty of TX's in the mempool, but when this block happened, many of the sub-1.0sat/vb transactions were omitted.  What's going on?

Is this the nodes/miners protesting the sub-1.0sat/vb minimum fee rate change?

Include Bitcoin in FIRE strategy?,"I figured this post is best fit here because the fire sub does not like bitcoin.

I finally took the losses,"My crypto holdings are like 90% BTC. I had been holding onto several bags of altcoins since 2021 wondering if they ever would regain their value. Some coins down 90%+ that weren't going anywhere. Should have just bought only BTC from the beginning and I would have made only gains. 

So now I'm taking what little was left from those shitcoins and rolling into BTC. Kept second guessing myself when to do this and thinking I should wait until BTC drops a bit - but it isn't dropping. Thought I should do this at $107K - now we're at $118K+. Trying to time this market is begging for insanity. 

Lesson here is just stack sats and don't worry about the price. It is still so early. I'll always wish I stacked more. 🚀",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m58k9v/i_finally_took_the_losses/,True,2025-07-21 03:39:40+00:00,"Error:

Your First Satoshi is Your First Step Towards Financial Freedom,"Hey everyone. This is mainly an encouragement post aimed at all the new people here. Welcome! Starting your Bitcoin journey can feel overwhelming with all the technical jargon and price volatility, but remember that every expert was once a beginner who took that crucial first step. 

The most important lesson I've learned is that Bitcoin isn't just about getting rich quick. It's about understanding a revolutionary technology that puts financial control back in your hands. Don't let the fear of ""buying at the wrong time"" paralyze you; dollar-cost averaging small amounts consistently beats trying to time the market perfectly. 

Focus on education first: learn about wallets, private keys, and why ""not your keys, not your coins"" is more than just a catchy phrase. The Bitcoin rabbit hole is deep and fascinating, leading you to understand money, economics, and technology in ways you never expected.

Selling sats from cold wallet,"Hello,

I was wondering what the best method would be to sell a small amount of BTC on a CEX (kraken or strike). Is it best to move the BTC from the cold wallet directly to the exchange, or is there any benefit in moving the coins from cold storage to a hot wallet and then to the exchange for sale.

In a video from Bitcoin University he mentioned to never move coins from your cold storage to a hot wallet due to privacy concerns, but if this is the case, then what is the best way to sell the coins? Thanks in advance.

It has begun...,"As Bitcoin surges past $120,000, a shadow figure emerges now worth over $120 billion.
He holds one million BTC in a single wallet.
And with that, he now rivals the net worth of Microsoft’s founder, Bill Gates.

But unlike Gates,whose empire is bound to traditional assets, this man is liquid.
He could, in theory, convert his entire fortune in a heartbeat.

Or could he?

Because here lies the paradox:
Ultimate power, but unusable without consequences.
To move it would be to destroy it.
To sell would be to crash the very thing that gives it value.
He is both kingmaker and hostage to the system he helped create.

A billionaire bound in code.
Silent. Watching. Waiting.
But this was never about wealth.
It was always about the trap.

The world’s largest financial institutions have now wrapped themselves in Bitcoin,
thinking they’ve joined the revolution.
But in truth, they’ve walked into a protocol designed to collapse the old world from within.

Satoshi’s design was not profit. 
It was precision. A clean kill.

And when the trigger is pulled, whether through greed, systemic failure or mass adoption, the debt based monetary system will unravel.

What comes next is not chaos.
It is something colder, cleaner, irreversible.

A new system will rise, trustless, borderless, incorruptible.

The game ends not with a bang, but with a whisper…

Where does the 2% come from?,"I propose a question to the communities. Trump has said that inflation is under control and that the Fed should drop rates by 3 points. Wild times. But it does raise a question.. why can the Fed not get inflation down to 0% and why is the target inflation rate 2%? 

Upon some further research i think i have come to a conclusion.  I have not seen any confirmation in this and this theory is based solely on trying to put 2 and 2 together. 

I asked ChatGPT how much Gold is mined and refined every year and the answer comes out to 1.3-1.7% of new supply of gold is entering the market every single year. Now I know that this number is still less than 2% but it is close for a starting point. I know that since 1971 the US Dollar has not been backed by physical gold but also the US Dollar is the world reserve currency. Meaning that is it has to be trusted by the world and is much easier to be trusted if the amount of new dollars that enter the market is equal to the amount of gold that is entering the market. Makes sense to me. 

Lets say that theory is true and that is where the 2% inflation comes from. With the dollar being unpegged to gold, gold should only be increasing by .3-.7% per year if those numbers are right. 
I know there is more to just global money with regards to how things are priced but it he fact that gold is up significantly more than that over the past few years should at least raise some concerns. 

Also if you look into other things like BTC with a stock to flow of eventually 0% then you would think at that rate, the value of BTC should only be rising at 2% per year. 

Basically what I am trying to say is that the CPI is a lie and nobody should look at it to make any judgements. 

Im a big Trump fan but I think even he can not keep a 2% inflation rate. I am a pilot and it is great to know that the $100 bill in my wallet for emergencies will be accepted everywhere. Growing up is now knowing that is a curse. Being the world reserve currency means that the USD is our biggest export. The government gives USD to other countries by stealing it from our paychecks. 

They will continue to do that. As we see that the price of low stock to flow assets like gold and BTC are giving a much higher return than the rate of CPI.

Lower the rates
Raise the rates
Lower taxes
Raise taxes
None of that will change the fact that slavery is still around and its called a 40hr work and retirement by 65 living below your means.

Before I was thinking about bit coin and it's value to fiat. 

But I actually get the idea behind what it was created for now! 

It was 💡 moment. 

So it's not about holding and selling at higher price. That defeats the objective of bitcoin. It's about collecting bitcoin and using it as a savings account so it doesn't lose value like traditional fiat currency and open to corruption. 

So basically collect as much BTC as I can do when it does change over in the future I'm ready!

To multisig or not to multisig?,"As I have gathered a large amount of sats over the past years, I am now considering switching from signlesig to multisig.

Now, I know there are some additional complications, and more things to screw up with multisig. I know how to handle all that, so I'm not concerned that I'll screw anything up.

My only concern is the Bitcoin fees. I know that in the past, multisig transactions used to be more expensive due to the fact that they include all the multisig information on the blockchain.

Now, it is my understanding that with taproot, multisig transactions are indistinguishable from singlesig on the blockchain. Do these still accrue higher fees with taproot?

Fees are not a concern to me at the moment, but I want to be prepared for potential future high-fee environments.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m4yztp/to_multisig_or_not_to_multisig/,True,2025-07-20 20:20:23+00:00,"Error:

Community thought experiment: When exchanges run dry,"Not your keys, not your coins. 

I often see charts and discussions about exchanges holding less and less bitcoin, emphasizing, once again, the importance of holding your own keys. 

I want to ask you all, though: What happens when the exchanges run dry?

&nbsp;

1. Will it happen? 

Won’t miners just keep selling to exchanges? Sure the block reward goes down over the years, but that just means that the price goes up. 

&nbsp;

2. If it happens, and it becomes very difficult to buy almost any amount of bitcoin, what happens to the value of bitcoin?

First I thought: If there’s very little bitcoin available to buy, then the majority of the world might check out, and it becomes less useful, thus losing value. 

But then I thought: Well, bitcoin is divisible, perhaps the exchanges will hold less bitcoin, but the sats will be worth way more, thus keeping up with the demand. 

&nbsp;

3. What does the world look like in 30 years, when institutions and whales (YOU included, because you bought early!) far outnumber the low amounts available on exchanges?

Will this just mean that 0.1 BTC = super rich status and exchanges keep going like normal, but standard dca buys are like 10 usd for like 1000 sats or 100 sats?

&nbsp;

Summarizing:

What do you think? Will exchanges ever actually run dry? What will happen to bitcoins value and use-case when sats is the norm and 0.1 coiners are wealthy as f?

My guess is it all just keeps going. Just had to write these thoughts out to see it more clearly.

Is it too late to own bitcoin?,"Man, I wish I knew about Bitcoin back in 2009–2011.
It’s wild—no one around me ever mentioned it or seemed to know about it either.

I first heard about BTC in 2017 when it was trading around $4,500. I didn’t really understand what it was at the time. From what I gathered back then, if you wanted to buy other coins, you had to first buy Bitcoin and then trade it for altcoins. With my limited knowledge and the platforms available at the time, it felt confusing and overwhelming. 🥲

Now I’ve got a few questions for the true BTC OGs out there:
	1.	How did you first hear about Bitcoin?
	2.	Do you think it’s too late to start buying now that it’s around $117k–$120k?
	3.	Any advice for someone looking to finally get in?

ISIS in Swaida against Druze,"Hey fellow Bitcoiners, brothers in the fight for financial sovereignty and freedom from tyranny!

I need to bring your attention to the horrifying massacre unfolding right now in Suwayda, Syria. Since July 13, 2025, clashes between local Druze armed groups and Bedouin fighters—backed by the HTS-led Syrian transitional government—have escalated into outright massacres. Triggered by a roadside robbery, it's turned into sectarian violence with reports of extrajudicial executions, abductions, looting, and hate speech.

The death toll has skyrocketed to over 516, including civilians: 79 Druze fighters, 261 government forces (including Bedouins), and dozens of innocents summarily executed—83 by government forces alone, plus 3 Bedouins killed by Druze fighters. In one gut-wrenching incident at the National Hospital of Suwayda, HTS troops stormed in and massacred staff and patients suspected of being Druze, leaving bodies strewn across the floor—doctors, nurses, women, and children among them. Even churches have been attacked and set on fire.

What's worse? Some of these forces include former ISIS commanders, blending old jihadist rivalries into this new chaos under HTS's banner. Israel has stepped in with airstrikes on Syrian positions to ""protect"" the Druze, killing more and risking wider war. The UN is calling for de-escalation, but civilians are caught in the crossfire, with thousands displaced.

As Bitcoiners, we know what centralized power and oppression look like—whether it's fiat regimes or authoritarian takeovers. This is why we build decentralized systems: to empower the oppressed, send aid without borders, and resist censorship. If you're moved, consider donating BTC to verified Syrian relief orgs helping Druze and Bedouin victims alike. Let's use our tools for good.

Help me,"So for context I hold less than 0.005 BTC. Not a lot by any means but im a student and therefore only buy what I can afford once all my costs are dealt with. My last purchase was I think the end of 2023 whilst prices were LOW. My average buy price is like $30k. I have some money that I can and indeed do want to put into BTC. My worry is that this purchase will take my average buy price all the way up to pretty much the current price of BTC. 

Now I know that the price will be WAYYYYYY higher in 4 years but for some reason Im just having trouble pulling the trigger. Convince me please. Im begging you. My conundrum is basically, will the 2026 bear market see prices lower than they are now? I dont think the price of bitcoin will go below $95k in the peak bear market, i could definitely be wrong, but even if the price were to go below $115000ish I would be at a loss and it doesn't account for future purchases this year when the price will be even higher.

Now im not going to be buying lots by anyone else's standards but for me this will be my largest ever single crypto purchase at around $800 with the potential for more in the next few months, which would drive the average price even higher. DCAing in when the market peaks and starts coming back down would be an option but im not comfortable leave this amount of money on any exchange for that long.

What do you think about Martti Malmi?,"https:// coinmarketcap. com /academy/article /satoshi-files-martti-malmi

 Martti 'Sirius' Malmi is a Finnish computer scientist and software developer who helped Satoshi develop Bitcoin during its first two years of operation, and was known for making the first Bitcoin to fiat transaction.



  
Malmi’s first tasks included writing Bitcoin’s documentation and creating a FAQ section to help people understand Bitcoin. He also set up the first Bitcoin community forum, which later became BitcoinTalk, the most well-known crypto forum. The community would gather to discuss Bitcoin’s direction, code and any new developments. Satoshi also asked Malmi to help him grow Bitcoin’s user base and community. At the same time, Malmi started working for Whitevector, where he and his team “developed and maintained a social media monitoring and analyzing product.”

One of the early challenges Satoshi and Malmi faced was how to assign a value to Bitcoin. After all, there weren’t any cryptocurrency exchanges in the early days, so deals had to be brokered over the web or even in person. In the end, it was Martti Malmi who would put Bitcoin on the map when he[ sold](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/transactions/btc/7dff938918f07619abd38e4510890396b1cef4fbeca154fb7aafba8843295ea2) 5,050 BTC for $5.02, which gave Bitcoin a value of $0.0009 per coin. We sincerely hope Malmi isn’t haunted by the fact that at Bitcoin’s[ peak](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) of $70,000, he would have banked $350 million.

DCA`ing advice?,"Does it mean when it is high, now I sell maybe 10% and keep that money ready for the dip, or does it mean you keep everything in but when a dip happens again and you think it's time to buy now because it's gone down to what you are ok with, you buy with new funds?



does it just mean buying dips when they are low when you have spare money aside to invest, or do you use the money you gain from highs and wait till it goes lower and rebuy with the same money invested and continue the cycle?

Do I regret it? - My short BTC story,"I've been buying BTC on monthly basis with my first transaction in Feb 10th 2021 where BTC price was roughly 43k EUR. Since then it was down all the way to 15k and now up to 105k recently. This is the only coin I have been buying regurally.

Now, do I regret doing so? Sadly, yes -- mostly because I have been buying it in amounts of 50 EUR a month. Looking at it now I wish, I had been buying 400-500 EUR a month instead as I well could have instead of putting that amount into ETFs. But I remember when that 50 EUR was being taken away and the price was 15k, it was also tough -- when everyone hated on BTC, where lawsuits and scandals where going on weekly basis.. I still believed, but did I believe enough? If I did, my +265% would be much bigger amount than it is now.

Now, someone may ask did I learn my lesson? I have. A while back I have decided to change the ratio and now adding 300 EUR worth of BTC instead of 50. I probably will look back at this moment in a few years when BTC is few hundered thousand or cloes to a million and think the same way I am thining now "" I wish I have invested more than just 300 EUR a month"".

Diversification is a curse and a blessing. Enjoy the ride peps!

Class from 2016 : I am joining the 21 btc soon,"Hi fellow Bitcoiners. I am from the class of 2016. Back then the 21 btc was the goal to have. Because you will own 1 millionth of the total supply obviously. I set this my target as newcomers now set their target for 1 or 0.1 btc. 

Needless to say that the road to this was not easy, with a lot of ups en downs. This post is not just an bragging post, but more like an encouragement that you need to keep stacking. You are not my exit liquidity. This was never a ponzi scheme. I never sold, even when my stack will probably hit 3 million soon. 

I never stopped stacking. My last buy was still at $117k. I don't DCA, just lump sum in.   
Also this post is to prove /r buttcoiners wrong. I don't sell for fiat. The world is financially changing. We are part of it. 

I have a regular job, just like any other person. My income is around $6000 per month. I do my usual things and save the rest to buy bitcoin. Don't forget to live your life. It isn't worth it if you use all your fiat to buy bitcoin. I am enjoying life, even without my btc wealth. 

Most of my stack is pre 2021. That is for sure. I bought only 2.5btc during the last 4 years, because it will get harder and harder to stack. Will I stop after 21 btc? Probably not. Probably not in the coming 5 years.

Bitcoin will set you free, especially your mindset about the future. So keep buying people! It will pay off eventually. Whether you will sell it for fiat or keep it in btc

he also says that if the peg ratio of stablecoins changes a bit then thats another bubble

he says btc is speculative but stablecoins is good becuase its backed by our very good dollar

Using Bitcoin to buy some time?,"Let's say, someone hypothetically has between 3 and 5 Bitcoin.

While selling is on one hand absolutely not an option before hitting that $500k to a million a coin (or something like that), and then only to achieve certain hard targets, not necessarily only cash out, selling 1 now (i guess indeed cashing out) would allow this person to seriously change their living circumstances for at least the next 4 years. Pretty much boiling down to much more ""time"". 

Would it be that insane to go down that road? Assuming that person still keeps multiple coins and has the conviction they will go to a million in 5 to 10 years, would it be too much of a gamble to do something like that?

Basically I'm wondering what the moment would be that Bitcoin could partially be used to alter a life and lifestyle, even though that wouldn't necessarily mean the ultimate jackpot or (for now) 100% financial ""independence"" for whatever that would mean. It would indeed mean to exchange it for cash in something of a high yield savings account to keep it from losing too much value, but yeah, cash to sustain a life.

Is it naive (asking the question is most likely answering it) to rely on a 4 year cycle narrative still or could it be a calculated gamble knowing there still are more coins in the Treasury? Tho of course, a ""downside"" would be to having to revert back to the previous type of life and working conditions.

Is it smart to sell $1K of Apple stock and buy Bitcoin instead?,"Hey everyone, 

I've been holding onto $1000 worth of Apple stocks (AAPL) and was considering selling it to buy Bitcoin. I'm curious if anyone here has done something similar or has thoughts this a smart move long term.

Apple is solid and stable, but not exactly high growth anymore. Bitcoin, on the other hand, feels riskier but has much higher upside potential. I'm in my 20s, so I can stomach some risk and I already have other investments in index funds (VOO, etc.)

Would love to hear what you all think, dumb move, calculated risk, or somewhere in between.

I asked AI to role-play as a non holder and to tell me what would convince them to buy.,"This is probably info that is known but could be interesting for some:

1. Real-Life Utility: If I saw people actually using bitcoin in day-to-day life—like paying for groceries, bills, or rent—and it was normal and easy, I’d start to think maybe it’s legit and worth having some. Like, if my favorite apps or stores just accepted it seamlessly, it’d feel more real.

2. Government Support/Regulation: If the government came out and said they officially support and regulate bitcoin, and maybe even offered some protection against fraud or loss, that would make me trust it more. Not like banning it or clamping down, but treating it seriously—making it clear it’s not going anywhere.

3. Stable Value: If it stopped jumping all over the place and actually acted more like a “store of value”—something I could trust to not just crash next week—I’d consider putting money in. Like if it held steady for a year or two, instead of wild swings.

4. People I Know Using It Successfully: If my friends or family—like, regular people—were talking about how they’ve used bitcoin for a few years and it’s worked out for them, not just “crypto bros” on Twitter, I’d take it more seriously.

“I don’t think hitting a price point would do it for me anymore. If it hit $500k tomorrow, I’d just assume it could crash right after. But if it started feeling normal, safe, and actually useful, I’d be more open to it. Until then, I’d probably keep my money where I know it won’t just disappear overnight.”

What’s the real security difference between using BlueWallet offline on an old phone and a hardware wallet?,"I currently use BlueWallet on an old smartphone that has been factory reset, has no SIM card, is in airplane mode, and has never been connected to the internet.

My question is:

What’s the actual security benefit of using a hardware wallet (like Trezor, Ledger, or Coldcard) over my current setup with BlueWallet offline?
