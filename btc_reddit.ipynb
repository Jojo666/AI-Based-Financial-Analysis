              "  'I\\'m posting this anonymously for obvious reasons.\\n\\nI shared my story here four years ago. If you are curious, you can find it. I\\'ve been involved with r/Bitcoin since the summer of 2017 when I first bought Bitcoin in the $2,000 range. I distinctly remember celebrating 250,000 subs here, and this subreddit has been a great educational and meme-motivational resource over that time.\\xa0\\n\\nThe Bull Market of 2017 was a wild ride. I experienced my first FOMO as the price went from $2,000 to $20,000. During that up-and-down cycle, I bought around one whole Bitcoin. I bought another full Bitcoin when it dropped to $4,000 in 2018. I felt satisfied with my 2 BTC, but my confidence waned so I didn’t continue stacking over the next 2 years.\\xa0\\n\\nIn the spring of 2020, I sold my house, switched jobs, and suddenly found myself sitting on $30,000 in cash from the sale of my home and around 55k in a 401k. I watched as Bitcoin went from 4k to 7, 8, 9, 10, instead of going down to zero as the critics claimed. I decided to go “all-in” with these funds so that’s what I did. I bought around 3 Bitcoin with the cash and the equivalent of just under 5 BTC in GBTC in a new 401k. This brought me to just under 10 Bitcoin split between private custody and a 401k.\\xa0\\n\\nI watched history repeat itself in the fall of 2020, but this time, I had some real exposure to better gains. I watched as my life savings went from around $100,000 to over $600,000 at the top of the cycle in early 2021. Then, I watched as my roughly $600,000 returned to around $170,000 during the bottom of the bear market in 2022. That was tough to witness, but I looked at it and said “I’m still up from where I started.” Once you get past a certain amount of savings, the big swings hit differently. Even during the bear market, I knew I still had at least a 1-year emergency fund, which comforted me.Fast-forward to a short while ago when Bitcoin hit 92k. I soon realized that with the equity in our home and my exposure to BTC, my wife and I were finally millionaires. We’re still driving the same beater cars to work. I rarely sell our BTC, but when I do, I try to buy things/ experiences that will improve the quality of life for my family, and I’m quick to replace what I sold.\\n\\nI make a middle-class income so I don’t often need to sell for the things I want/ need. Whenever I see a used car, 4-wheeler, boat, or new home I’m tempted to buy, I think to myself “I’d rather have Bitcoin.” The peace of mind it offers far outweighs the benefits of more junk. I used to tell myself I’d pay off my mortgage using proceeds from Bitcoin, but my mortgage is only about 9% of my take-home pay, and the interest rate is lower than inflation. I believe we will see 250k-280k by the end of next year, and the cycle will start again.\\n\\nOne downside to having such a nice safety net is that work has become very tedious. I have very little motivation to put in the extra time or to go “above and beyond.” I do my job, I do it well, I make money for my employer, but I’m not pushing for more like I would if I were still broke. I’ll post again in four more years with an update. I’m hoping to retire by 2030-2034. Stay safe out there, and only invest in Bitcoin what you’re willing to keep!\\n\\n  \\n\\\\*edit\\\\* There seems to be a ton of questions regarding whether or not I was actually broke so let me clarify. \"Broke\" to me means you only have a couple thousand dollars to your name. You can be broke and be making money. There are people who make 150k a year and they are broke. In 2017, our household income was probably around 92-95k so just under 48k per person. Earlier in 2017, we bought a home with 100% financing because we couldn\\'t save up a deposit. That home was worth around 135k. We had a 4.5% mortgage rate on a 15-year mortgage. \\n\\n\\n\\nWe only had $1,000 in an emergency fund when we first started buying Bitcoin. We managed to cut back on some expenses and gradually bought Bitcoin all the way up and down. I don\\'t think we became wholecoiners until the market crashed. I seem to recall the second Bitcoin was purchased aound $4,000, and that money was from a tax return check. That\\'s one of the only ways broke people get a nice chunk of money at once. Trump raised the child tax credit so we got a nice check from that. \\n\\n  \\nWe sold our house in 2020 for a little over 200k, so we walked away with like 65k. We then put 25k deposit on a new house, bought some furniture, riding lawnmower, etc and when the dust settled we still had about 30k leftover. That\\'s where the bulk of the Bitcoin came from. Well, that plus the transferring of the 401k. I hope this clears things up.',\n",
              "  'I originally bought my first Bitcoins in 2012, while living in Europe, as a means for buying substances of ill repute.  At any given time, I had several of them in an online wallet (don’t even remember where). I eventually stopped partying so much, but still had 3-4 laying around.  By the time I moved back to the US in 2015, I remembered the wallet and was shocked to see that what was originally maybe $50 worth of coins had turned into something like $1500. I didn’t understand it, but that is when I started reading more about it.  I would talk about it with friends and try to convince them to buy.  I eventually built my stack up to about 7 bitcoins by late 2017. As the price soared, I kept imagining my life as a millionaire.  When the crash happened, I forgot all about its cyclic nature and panicked, selling 4 of them around the $7K mark.  I invested that $30K and left the 3 remaining bitcoins in my wallet.  And they stayed there for 6 more years.  In 2023, I sold another one for about $25K to help pay for my wedding. At that point I vowed to not sell my last 2 until it mooned.  Today, my wife and I did something we never thought possible - we made an offer on an investment property.  It was accepted tonight and I sold my last two remaining bitcoins, for just shy of $200K so that I had the funds for a down payment.\\n\\nMaybe I played the game horribly.  Maybe I would have $700K worth of bitcoin if I stuck to my original plan of keeping 7 bitcoins.  I don’t know. Feels pretty good to turn a pretty small investment into a 25% down payment on an investment property though.\\n\\nI’ll continue to occasionally buy bitcoin after this, but I recognize that I may never afford to ever get close to owning 1 BTC ever again, let alone multiple.  But I’m ok with it.  I got a debt-free wedding and an investment property out of it.  I’m happy.\\n\\nJust a little story to say that it’s ok to use your bitcoin to fund your life along the way.  It’s likely part of the journey.  Be well. \\n\\n\\nEdit:  I’m blown away by all the responses!  I honestly expected it to be 80% negative.  So, thank you to those well wishers.  I honestly get and understand the negative sentiment.  I found myself in an unbelievably lucky position and squandered it all away (according to naysayers).  I will continue to believe in and buy bitcoin.  There’s still plenty of time to invest in it as a retirement option.  I wanted passive income and diversification, and I don’t think there’s anything wrong with that.  Cheers. \\n\\nEdit 2:  Lots of comments/questions about taxes.  Yes, it’s all capital gains. Yes, we are covered. Long story short, my wife worked for a major tech company that paid her in stock as part of her salary. Instead of cashing her shares every month, she kept them and lived off just her salary.  That stock tanked 3 years ago and has lost 70+% of its value.  She finally sold yesterday so that we can write off her losses against my gains.',\n",

Back in 2022, I knew we were in a bear market. I also knew that it wouldn’t last more than a year or two.\\xa0\\n\\nSo think of it like a reverse DCA. I pay the loans each month instead of DCA. This allowed me to buy a lot more Bitcoin than I otherwise would have been able to buy. I can easily afford the monthly payments to service the debt.\\n\\n2.  **This is too risky. You’re insane. You’re gambling. Never take out loans to buy Bitcoin!**\\n\\nNot at all… I have a thesis an a strategy!\\xa0\\n\\nMy thesis is simple: due to reckless fiscal and monetary policy (money printing) by our government, the US dollar will continue to depreciate in value, i.e. inflation.\\xa0\\n\\nMy strategy: take out loans in USD and buy hard money like BTC which will appreciate in value against the USD.\\xa0\\n\\nThe strategy is basically a speculative attack on the US dollar. Wall Street traders do the same thing all the time. Have you hear of the Yen Carry Trade? I’m doing the same thing except with USD and BTC.\\n\\nTaking out loans to buy assets is fine, so long as you can afford to service them.

Initially tasked with studying Bitcoin as a developing currency, the team treated it as routine work. However, after presenting their first report, they were directed by the Board of Governors to scale their analysis, focusing on Bitcoin as a major currency, including simulations of money flows, interest rates, and its global impact on macroeconomic policy.\\n\\nThe team's findings were shocking: even with moderate adoption, Bitcoin could drastically disrupt traditional currency models and monetary policy. Their simulations indicated that by **2021** (worst-case) or **2026** (best-case), Bitcoin could surpass the US dollar’s global dominance, weakening the Federal Reserve's control.

              "  \"Hello friends of r/Bitcoin!\\n\\nI am taking the liberty of sharing this post, originally posted on the r/MSTR sub, as I think many of you might not realise this.\\n\\nToday, I'd like to discuss/shed light on an angle of MicroStrategy that I think\\xa0**almost everyone is overlooking**.\\n\\nI've been following MicroStrategy (MSTR) and its Bitcoin strategy for a long while now, and it’s striking how many investors only scratch the surface. Most people look at MSTR’s play and think, “They’re just leveraging up to buy Bitcoin, hoping it appreciates.” But what’s actually happening under the hood involves a much deeper interplay of bond markets, repo markets, and broker-dealer dynamics that the average investor simply isn’t aware of.\\n\\n**The Bond/Repo/Broker Dealer Triangle**  \\nAt the core, you have a system where bond creation and leverage are integral to how capital is formed and deployed. When MSTR issues debt (often convertible notes) to finance Bitcoin purchases, they’re effectively tapping into a part of the financial system that can summon liquidity out of thin air. Broker dealers often provide financing for these bonds, using them as collateral, which allows enormous amounts of capital to move into digital assets without traditional hurdles.\\n\\nHere’s a simplified version of what happens:\\n\\n1. **MSTR issues bonds**\\xa0– These aren’t ordinary loans. They can be convertible notes or other structured products, which the market eagerly snaps up.\\n2. **Broker dealers and repo markets come into play**\\xa0– Once the bonds hit the secondary markets, broker dealers can pledge them as collateral in the repo market, effectively multiplying the money supply and tapping into a well of liquidity. This isn’t “new” in finance; it’s how a significant part of the global capital market operates. But applying this mechanism to fund Bitcoin purchases is still relatively novel.\\n3. **No Direct Need for Traditional Adoption Flows**\\xa0– With these sophisticated financial instruments, MSTR doesn’t need a constant stream of retail or even traditional institutional adoption in the usual sense. The system itself, through these bond and repo mechanics, creates the liquidity needed. The money is essentially conjured from market structures already in place for bonds—just now, that capital is flowing into Bitcoin.\\n\\n**Why Most Investors Don’t Get It**  \\nA lot of people simply see the headlines: “MSTR Buys More Bitcoin” or “Another Convertible Offering.” They think it’s a high-stakes gamble, akin to putting all their chips on black and hoping it hits. But MSTR’s CEO, Michael Saylor, is playing a far more intricate game—one that involves macroeconomic principles, global market plumbing, and the subtle orchestration of credit expansion via bond issuance.\\n\\nIf you’ve ever wondered why bond offerings are oversubscribed and why sophisticated market participants keep fueling MSTR’s strategy, it’s because these players aren’t just betting on Bitcoin’s price. They’re participating in a financial ecosystem where capital can be created at will and deployed wherever there’s perceived upside. The Bitcoin exposure is a cherry on top—an easily accessible way to gain indirect exposure to a traditionally “hard-to-hold” asset.\\n\\n**Beyond CFA-Level Analysis**  \\nI'm sure by now most of you have seen a certain, semi known, CFA on YouTube giving his opinion on this thing. What he's not understanding, (amongst many other things), is that there is literally\\xa0**endless money**\\xa0ready to go. A standard CFA curriculum might teach you how bonds work, how repo markets function in theory, and how collateralization reduces credit risk. But MSTR’s approach combines these mechanics in a way that’s more macroeconomic engineering than straightforward investing. It leverages the nature of modern finance—where liquidity can be created through collateral chains and rehypothecation—to accumulate a digital asset that many believe will fundamentally appreciate over time.\\n\\nThis isn’t a simple “buy low, sell high” strategy. It’s about using the fiat/bond market plumbing itself as a tool. When people say “money is made up on the spot,” they’re talking about this exact kind of liquidity generation. And MSTR is capitalizing on it. There is literally\\xa0**endless money to support this dynamic.**\\n\\n**TL;DR:**  \\nMSTR’s Bitcoin play is not merely a bet on BTC price appreciation through ATM-offerings and convertible debt. It’s a masterclass in understanding the deepest layers of financial plumbing—leveraging bond issuance, repo markets, and broker dealers to continuously channel capital into Bitcoin. The result is a kind of financial flywheel that most casual observers can’t see, and that’s exactly why it’s genius. You don’t have to agree with the endgame, but it’s hard not to appreciate the complexity and sophistication of what MSTR is doing behind the scenes.\",\n",

Price is hanging around $60k/$61k right now and this fear/greed index on CMC is at 44. It was \\\\~84, in \"extreme greed\", at the end of February at the same price. Now sentiment is almost straight up bearish. Price is double what it was 8 months ago and we\\'re almost tipping into fear.\\n\\nFor all you people (whoever you are) who are actually afraid right now, this is why spending several months with the price ranging is great and sooo healthy for the market. $60,000s is now completely normalized and is not exciting at all, in fact quite the opposite, people are actually worried now whenever price drops in the low or mid $60,000s.\\n\\nA few months ago at the same price people were acting like we were in full on bull run mode and some parts of the market were entering into extreme hype. Now with a few months of ranging sideways in the $60,000s the super hyped up price is a boring lower fearful price.\\n\\nWhile we are still at the same price as 4 months ago, what the market has gotten in exchange for that is a base double the price of the old base from last year. We\\'ve gotten a market that moved from extreme greed to nearly fearful while maintaining the same price. That is a big healthy market expansion in just a few months.\\n\\nThis is how Bitcoin keeps going up forever. By prices that were once considered high, now considered totally normal and boring and will soon be considered low. The market only goes up sustainably when market sentiment normalizes a price range. This Spring the market has normalized the $60,000s as a boring sh\\\\*tty price whereas at the start of the year people would have been busting in excitement over this price this soon.\\n\\nBitcoiners or anyone with a good understanding of finance gets this. If you don\\'t get this and you are fearful right now, keep educating yourself!  \\n',\n",

Each post's content was passed through the model with a prompt designed to classify sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. The model's responses were integrated into a structured dataset, allowing us to analyze overall sentiment trends. A bar plot visualization of the results revealed the distribution of sentiments across the posts, providing insight into the prevailing tone of discourse within the dataset. This LLM-based approach enabled nuanced, context-aware sentiment classification beyond traditional keyword or lexicon-based methods."

Is Bitcoin projected to outperform SPMO over the next 3 to 5 years?\\n2. Based on that outlook, would you recommend holding onto SPMO or selling it in favor of Bitcoin?\\n3. What would you personally do, considering the current market trends and future projections?\\n\\nI appreciate any input.  Thank you!\",\n          \"I propose a question to the communities. Trump has said that inflation is under control and that the Fed should drop rates by 3 points. Wild times. But it does raise a question.. why can the Fed not get inflation down to 0% and why is the target inflation rate 2%? \\n\\nUpon some further research i think i have come to a conclusion.  I have not seen any confirmation in this and this theory is based solely on trying to put 2 and 2 together. \\n\\nI asked ChatGPT how much Gold is mined and refined every year and the answer comes out to 1.3-1.7% of new supply of gold is entering the market every single year. Now I know that this number is still less than 2% but it is close for a starting point. I know that since 1971 the US Dollar has not been backed by physical gold but also the US Dollar is the world reserve currency. Meaning that is it has to be trusted by the world and is much easier to be trusted if the amount of new dollars that enter the market is equal to the amount of gold that is entering the market. Makes sense to me. \\n\\nLets say that theory is true and that is where the 2% inflation comes from. With the dollar being unpegged to gold, gold should only be increasing by .3-.7% per year if those numbers are right. \\nI know there is more to just global money with regards to how things are priced but it he fact that gold is up significantly more than that over the past few years should at least raise some concerns. \\n\\nAlso if you look into other things like BTC with a stock to flow of eventually 0% then you would think at that rate, the value of BTC should only be rising at 2% per year. \\n\\nBasically what I am trying to say is that the CPI is a lie and nobody should look at it to make any judgements. \\n\\nIm a big Trump fan but I think even he can not keep a 2% inflation rate. I am a pilot and it is great to know that the $100 bill in my wallet for emergencies will be accepted everywhere. Growing up is now knowing that is a curse. Being the world reserve currency means that the USD is our biggest export. The government gives USD to other countries by stealing it from our paychecks. \\n\\nThey will continue to do that. As we see that the price of low stock to flow assets like gold and BTC are giving a much higher return than the rate of CPI.\\n\\nLower the rates\\nRaise the rates\\nLower taxes\\nRaise taxes\\nNone of that will change the fact that slavery is still around and its called a 40hr work and retirement by 65 living below your means. \\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 592,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m5d4k1/am_i_delusional/\",\n          \"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1m423fa/whats_the_real_security_difference_between_using/\",\n          \"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1maeuvc/daily_discussion_july_27_2025/\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_type\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"time\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 592,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-07-21 08:10:45+00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
